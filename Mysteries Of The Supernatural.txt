** Mysteries of The Supernatural **
1. The Law of Faith
	Numbers 23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: 
	hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
	Hebrews 11:6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must 
	believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

	Faith in God is base on:
	1. Integrity
	2. Ability - Ephesians 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that 
				we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
				
	Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye 
	receive them, and ye shall have them.
	Isaiah 43:26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
	
2. The Law of Impartation
	Numbers 27:18 And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, 
	and lay thine hand upon him;
	Deutoronomy 34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands 
	upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.
	Numbers 11:25  And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, 
	and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, 
	and did not cease.
