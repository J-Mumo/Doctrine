Psalm 34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.

Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

2 Corinthians 4:17-18 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

1 Corinthians 15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The bible is clear that there will be moments of affliction, losses, pain and challenges.
Psalm 20:1-5 The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.

Genesis 15:1-3 After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
Genesis 16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

Exodus 1:8-14 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

Job 1&2

Ruth 1:1-5 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.

Luke 22

Acts 12:1-4 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.

Believers must be trained to know and respond to these periods of afflictions.
John 16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

** Keys to experience victory in the midst of challenges **
1. Look unto Jesus
  Psalm 34:1-10 I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
  My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
  O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.
  I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
  They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
  This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
  The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
  O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
  O fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
  The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.

  Hebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

  To look: Direct ones gaze or focus away from other things towards someone or something
          To rely on or to depend totally upon

  Numbers 21:4-9 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
  And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
  And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
  And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
  And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

  Psalm 123:1-2 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
  Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.

  ** Why should you look unto Jesus **
    Psalm 127:1-2 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
    It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

    Romans 9:16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.

    Psalm 62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.

    Psalm 20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.

    Psalm 113:1-9 Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.
    Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.
    From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised.
    The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
    Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,
    Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
    He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
    That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
    He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.

  Matthew 11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

2. Commit to prayer
  James 5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.

  1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.

3. Meditate upon and speak the Word over that situation
  Joel 3:10 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

  Isaiah 3:10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

  Psalm 107:2-3 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
  And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

4. Seek comfort, prayer and help from Godly friends and from the family of believers.
  Acts 4:21-24 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.
  For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
  And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
  And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

  1 Thessalonians 5:25 Brethren, pray for us.

  Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

  Living an isolated christian life will not profit you in the day of adversity.

  Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?
  And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

  Matthew 5:7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

  Galatians 6:10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

5. Engage the prophetic
