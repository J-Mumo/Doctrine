** The Ordinances Of Heaven **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3ntF4g0wTs

Job 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
Psalms 49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

Dominion on earth has two major expressions:
1. Creation and manifestation of divine possibilities
2. Correction and restoration: Bringing every anti-Christ condition to the obedience of Christ
	2 Corinthians 10:4-5  (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
	
	2 Corinthians 4:18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
	
** The Word of God **
Genesis 1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
Colossians 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
Psalms 138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.

Revelation 5:4-5 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

To have access to the riches of the Word:
1. The book has to be open
2. The seals have to be loosed

Isaiah 29:11-12 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:
And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

We have established that the Word of God is the foundation for dominion and all things including all other laws submit to the Word of God

Ordinance: A law set forth by a governmental authority.
			A decree
			AN AUTHORIZED PATHWAY / APPROACH
			
**Ordinances that control dominion**
1. Knowledge
	John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
	Psalms 49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
	
	Luke 4:15-17 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had OPENED the book, he FOUND the place where it was written,
	
2. Knowledge of the conditions and demands for the activation of a piece of knowledge e.g, promise (Understanding)
	Leviticus 9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.
	
	Deuteronomy 28:1-2 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
	And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.
	
	John 2:5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
	
	The knowledge of the truth and understanding of the condtions that activate that truth = revelation
	Ephesians 1:17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
	
3. Faith to engage the principals
	Faith = obedience
	Faith = The action that you take based on who God is, and the integrity of His Word
	
	Hebrews 4:1-2 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
	Hebrews 4:9-11  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
	
4. The power of words
	Ministry of prayer and prophetic declarations
	Ecclesiastes 8:4  Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
	Job 22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
	James 5:15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
	The prayer of faith is Word inspired, Word based 
	
5. The Annointing
	2 Peter 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
	Acts 4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
	Ephesians 1:19 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
	Luke 24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
	Luke 1:34-35 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
	
	You cannot embrace power ignoring the ministry of the Holy Spirit
	John 1:12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
	Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
	Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
