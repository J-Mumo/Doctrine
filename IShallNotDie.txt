Psalm 91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

1. God's desire is we live our lives to the fullest

    all the days ordained for me were written in your book
    before one of them came to be.
	
	John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
	
2. We can die before our time and days can be prolonged
	Ecclesiastes 7:17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
	
	Psalms 55:23  But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
	
	Deuteronomy 5:33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
	
	Deuteronomy 6:1-2 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:
	That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
	
3. In most cases God is not behind the untimely death, especially of the saints
	Isaiah 65:20 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
	
	Ezekiel 18:32  For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.
	
4. Satan is the one who steals, kills and destroys

** Keys to longevity **
1. Submitting to Jesus who is the Resurrection and the Life
	John 11:25-26 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
	
2. The fear of the Lord: Means to honour, rever, respect and obey Him
	Proverbs 10:27 The fear of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
	
	Proverbs 9:10-11 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
	For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
	
	Proverbs 3:1-2 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
	For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
	
	1 Kings 3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
	
3. The power of scripture based confession
	Psalms 34:12-14 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
	Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
	
	Proverbs 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
	
4. Honor to parents both physical & spiritual
	Ephesians 6:1-3 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
	Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;
	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
	
	Proverbs 20:20 If someone curses their father or mother, their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.
	
5. Engaging the mystrey of the communion
	1 Corinthians 11:24-30 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
	
	Exodus 12:12-13 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord.
	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
	Exodus 12:23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
	
6. Master the art of spiritual warfare
	Ezekiel 13:17-23 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
	And say, Thus saith the Lord God; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?
	And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
	Wherefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.
	Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
	Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
	
	Warfare entails:
	- Standing based on the Word of God to enforce your authority
	
7. Walking in wisdom
	Proverbs 3:13-18 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
	For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
	She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
	Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
