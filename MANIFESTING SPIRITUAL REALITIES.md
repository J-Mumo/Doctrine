  Psalm 20:1-2 The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;

  Psalm 84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
5. As part of commitment towards kingdom advance

There is a spiritual and a physical realm:
  Romans 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

  Colossians 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

  Matthew 3:16-17 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
  And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

Realities are only made manifest if we learn how to transport those realities from the realm of the spirit to the physical realm.
  John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
  Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

## Challenges in manifesting spiritual realities
1. Ignorance of the provisions and the resources available to the believer in Christ
  2 Peter 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:

  Ephesians 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:

2. Ignorance on how to convert those spiritual provisions to their material expressions for the profiting of the believer.
  Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

The ability to convert spiritual resources to their material expressions for the profiting of the saints.

## Keys that help men transport spiritual realities according to the will of God and give it material expressions.
All kingdom resources are first spiritual.
1. Contend for light.
  - Knowledge of the resources that are available to you in Christ.

2. Press into the realm of consciousness and conviction.
  - This is the assignment of meditation.
  - Meditation involves hearing, speaking and imagination.
  - You are conscious of a thing when it gains dominance over your thoughts
  Psalm 36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
  Psalm 119:97-99 O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
  Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
  I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.

3. Mix the truth you know with faith
  Hebrews 4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.

4. Get in spiritual warfare.
  Establishing victory over spirits and conditions that fight the manifestation of the Word of God in your life.
  1 Corinthians 16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
  1 Thessalonians 2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.

5. Expect and prepare for the ministry of men.
  - The final arrival / manifestation of supernatural realities happens through the ministry of men.
  John 5:7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
  
  1 Samuel 10:3-4 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
  And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.

  John 6:5-9 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?” 6 He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
  Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages[a] to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!”
  Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, 
  “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?”
