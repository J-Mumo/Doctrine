Deuteronomy 28:1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

Matthew 17:1-5 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

Matthew 5:13-14 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.

Micah 4:1-2 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

Daniel 4:20-22 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.

Visible: Capable of being seen / perceived by the eye.
         Manifest / obvious / unmistakeable.
         To move beyond confinement.
         Able / likely to attract notice / attention.

## Why visibility
1. So that our ministry as witnesses and kingdom ambassadors can be effective.
  Matthew 5:15-16 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

2. So that the gospel can reach the unreached so that it can lead to a greater harvest.

3. A reward and consolation to our knowing, loving and serving Jesus.

## Key to visibility
1. Death to self
  Dying to the insatiable appetite for vain glory.
  Tame the tendency for overestimating oneself.
  Die to the obsession for fame and over celebration.
  To have a desire to project Jesus more than self.
  John 3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.

2. Enlightenment and transformation
  Acquiring useful strategic knowledge that leads to superior belief systems
  Isaiah 60:1 Arise [from the depression and prostration in which circumstances have kept youâ€”rise to a new life]! Shine (be radiant with the glory of the Lord), for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you!

  Genesis 13:14-15 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
  For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

  Psalm 78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.

3. Value and productivity
  Superior solutions that relate to and solve human needs.
  It demands skill, training, unlearning and re-learning, upgrading to best practices.
  A skillful and intelligent presentation of your solutions. A great solution presented poorly will hardly be received and rewarded.
  Your value to men will define their perception of your importance.
  Proverbs 22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

  Mark 1:35-37 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
  And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
  And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.

4. Strategic connections
  Relationships are advantageous connections that are mutually beneficial to the parties involved.
  Learn people skills.
  Real wealth is access to the hearts of men.

  ### Laws to excel in relationships
  1. Law of honor.
  2. Law of words.
  3. The law of timing.
    Proverbs 15:23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!
  4. Human nature: Greed, selfishness, ego, emotional inconsistencies.

5. The power of true humility
  James 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

  James 4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

  Pride is a reducer of honor and grace
  Proverbs 29:23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.

  Isaiah 2:11-12 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
  For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:

  Philippians 2:8-9 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

  Always acknowledge God as the basis of any result in your life.

  Celebrate success and achievment with bounderies.

6. Passionately seek the help of God (divine empowerment)
  2 Corinthians 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

  Psalm 75:6-7 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
  But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.

  Psalm 18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

  Psalm 127:1-2 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
  It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

  Psalm 118:23 This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
  
  Jeremiah 17:7-8 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.
  For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
