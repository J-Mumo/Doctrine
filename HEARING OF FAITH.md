## The hearing of faith
Galatians 3:5-6 So then, does He who supplies you with His [marvelous Holy] Spirit and works miracles among you, do it as a result of the works of the Law [which you perform], or because you [believe confidently in the message which you] heard with faith?
Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, [as conformity to God’s will and purpose—so it is with you also].

The ministry of the Spirit works on the heart and mind.
The ministry of the Spirit and working of miracles is at the mercy of the hearing of faith.
Acts 10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.

The hearing of faith is the entire process that leads to your believing God and receiving from Him.
### Dimensions to the hearing of faith
1. The correctness of what you hear.
  Mark 4:23-24 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
  And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.

  Luke 13:11-12 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.
  And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
  Luke 13:16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?

  #### What you need to hear that powers the hearing of faith
  1. God is love. It is in the character of love to give.
    1 John 4:8, 16 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
    And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

  2. Jesus came as an expression of the Father's love to you
    John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

  3. The price for your sin, healing, deliverance, freedom from poverty, longevity, prosperity, health & life, entering your prophetic destiny, that mantle to enter your life has been fully paid.
    Colossians 1:12-14 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
    Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
    In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

    Colossians 2:13-14 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
    Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

  4. It is not the will of God for you to remain in any situation that does not glorify God.
    Matthew 8:1-3 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.
    And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
    And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

  5. God is glorified when the Word is made manifest in your life
    Matthew 9:6-8 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.
    And he arose, and departed to his house.
    But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.

2. Your attitude while you receive
  Luke 8:18 Be careful therefore how you listen. For to him who has [spiritual knowledge] will more be given; and from him who does not have [spiritual knowledge], even what he thinks and [a]guesses and [b]supposes that he has will be taken away.

  Hebrews 4:1-2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.

  James 1:22-25 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
  For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
  For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
  But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

  Only those who obediently act on the Word get results from it.

  Psalm 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
  ### Ways to access the sent Word.
  1. Light from scripture.
  Luke 4:17-21 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
  And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
  And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.

  Hebrews 10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

  2. Prophetic instructions directly from God or through His anointed vessels.
  John 5:6-9 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
  Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
  And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

  3. By prophetic declarations
  Ezekiel 37:7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
  Ezekiel 2:2 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
