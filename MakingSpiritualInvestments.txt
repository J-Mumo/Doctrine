** Making Spiritual Investments **

Galatians 6:7-9 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.

Seeds to sow:
1. The Word
	Acts 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
	
2. Fellowship
	Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
	Psalm 133:1 Behold how good and pleasant it is when brethren dwell together in unity
	Psalm 133:3 For there the Lord commanded the blessing; Life forever more
	
5. Obedience
	Deuteronomy 28:1-2 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
	And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.
	
	
** The path to spiritual progress **

Galatians 4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

I Corinthians 13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

Spiritual maturity is not a mystrey.
Luke 2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

** Keys to maximum spiritual progress **
1. The ministry of prayer. Prayer is not the only key in the kingdom, but it must be involved every process of the kingdom.
	Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
	1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing
	Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
	James 5:13-16 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
	Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

	**Assignment of prayer**
	1. Growth and transformation
		Luke 9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
		Matthew 26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
	2. Spiritual legislation. The ability to make decrees and manifest spiritual possibilities in your life.
		Job 22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
		Job 38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
	3. Warfare and intercession
		Ephesians 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
	4. Platform for obtaining requests and granting petitions
		Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
		
		
2. The ministry of the Word
	Acts 20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
	2 Timothy 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
	
3. Discipleship: Submit yourself to learning and properly mentored
	Acts 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
	Acts 19:1-7 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,
	He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
	And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.
	Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
	And all the men were about twelve.
	
4. Service
	- Service in the house of God.
	- Service as a witness
	
	Exodus 23:25 And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
	Psalm 84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
	Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
	Acts 4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
	Malachi 3:17-18 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
	Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
