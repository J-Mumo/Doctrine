https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dBP4ZFlwzo&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Romans 15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

Acts 3:1-8 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.
And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

1. The basis for the miracle above was prayer.
  Many things happen during prayer.
  Philippians 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

  Luke 9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.

  Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

  1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.

2. The degrading power of afflictions and calamities.
  The afflicted man was referred to as a certain man lame, not his name.
  Your problem becomes greater than your name.
  - A woman with the issue of blood
  - A blind man

  Isaiah 62:2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.

  God can re-write a man's story.
  God can give men a new name.

3. Sometimes people are plagued with conditions that are not their making.
  * lame from his mother's womb
  John 9:1-3 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
  Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

  The origin of an afflication / condition is not as important as the determination to be free from it.

4. There are consiquences to prolonged negative conditions. e.g low self esteem, anger, recsentment, hatred, a wrong perception about God.

5. At least four miracles happened to this man.
  - Certain men believed in him to carry him daily.
  Acts 3:2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily 

  - The gate beautiful was polished bronze that it shown. This man could see beauty even when his life was ugly. This would change his perception and increase his faith.
  Acts 3:2 at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful

  - The ability to look beyond his pain and humble himself to be carried.
  Luke 16:1-4 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
  And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.
  Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

  The first miracle you need is not a change of condition, but a change of perception.

6. There were 2 abilities in that man that he recognized and used. His ability to see / percieve and his ability to ask.
  Matthew 7:7-8 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

7. His remaining in that condition was no longer an issue of his foundation or upbringing but his mentality.
  You can ask questions that lead to knowledge that lead to liberty.

8. Seeing the right people was the God factor in this miracle.
  The mentality to rise up and walk attracted the ability to rise up and walk.
  Acts 3:3-6 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
  And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
  And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
  Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.

  Knowledge makes your praying and asking most rewarding.

9. The name of Jesus without faith on the part of the receiver will faile to deliver results.
  Acts 3:7-8 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
  And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

## Conclusion
1. Rise up and walk is a prophetic call to partner with God and to step into new seasons, to open up new chapters concerning your life and destiny, to step into new horizons of kingdom exploits.

2. The mentality to rise up and walk is your part, the ability to rise up and walk is God's part. While you wait for the hand of God to be revealed in your life, labor in the Word to build the mentality that can attract and preserve the miracle.

3. Every manifestation of the hand of God upon your life should draw you closer to God and not away from God.
  Acts 3:8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

4. For every manifestation of the hand of God upon your life and destiny, realize that you owe it to give God praise, thanks and glory.
  Acts 3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

5. Acts 3:11-12 Now while he [still] firmly clung to Peter and John, all the people in utmost amazement ran together and crowded around them in the covered porch (walk) called Solomon’s.
And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, You men of Israel, why are you so surprised and wondering at this? Why do you keep staring at us, as though by our [own individual] power or [active] piety we had made this man [able] to walk?

6. But Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have; but what I do have I give to you: In the name (authority, power) of Jesus Christ the Nazarene—[begin now to] walk and go on walking!”
