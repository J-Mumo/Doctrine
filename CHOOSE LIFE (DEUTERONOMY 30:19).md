Joshua 24:13-15 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.
And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

Deuteronomy 30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

Decisions decide destiny
Every decision is connected to consequence
A consequence is a corresponding outcome.

To Choose: You have to be aware of all the other options that are available alongside the outcomes they create.

Choose life means to conclude on a path to follow after careful examination of the careful outcomes they produce.

Choices and decisions are pathways, they always lead somewhere. 
Prolonged indecision is giving circumstances permission to choose for you.

It takes making decisions to rise in life, it takes making decisions to fail.

Curses and enchantents manipulate you into making wrong choices and decisions so that your outcome becomes predictably bad.

The real value of wisdom is in its ability to help you make superior destiny advancing decisions.

## Destiny defining decisions you must make
1. Know the Lord and serve Him all the days of your life
  Matthew 22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
2. Contend for a superior belief system
  Proverbs 23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
3. Live a life of purpose and meaning
  Hebrews 10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
4. Contend for health & longevity
5. Be financially & economically empowered
  John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
6. Build strategic destiny relationships
7. Be a blessing
  Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

### Choose life means choose:
1. Health
