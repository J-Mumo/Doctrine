	that they go forward:

	your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
	
1. The Law of Vision
	Jeremiah 1:11-12 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, 
	I see a rod of an almond tree.
	Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
	
	There's a relationship between speed and vision
	
	Genesis 13:14-15 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, 
	and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
	For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

3. The Law of Transformation
	Proverbs 23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
	
	A mindset is a sustained thinking pattern, it's a view point, it's a perspective.
	A stronghold is a mindset that has been fortified by the presence of demon spirits, so that the victim is kept
	perpetually in that line of thought. It makes the Word of God of none effect.
	
	Process of transformation:
	- Awareness
