**The origin of satan and demon spirits**
Isaiah 14:12-17: How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, 
	which didst weaken the nations!
	For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: 
	I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
	Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
	They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
	That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

Ezekiel 28:11-15: Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
	Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.
	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
	Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
	Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.
	By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
	Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.
	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
	All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.

**Why does satan trouble himself this much**
Dominion & Alleigance
Matthew 4:8:9
	Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
	And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.

**Why does satan think he can win in the end**
He believes he will compell the entire creation to come under his lordship

**Structure and operation of satan and demons**
Ephesians 6:11: Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles(schemes) of the devil.
2 Corinthians 2:11: Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

1. Satan and demons fight:
	Revelation 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

2. Satan hinders / resists:
	1 Thessalonians 2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
	
3. Satan & demons steal, kill & destroy
	John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
	Matthew 13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
	
4. Satan & demons lie
	John 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
	
5. Disguise / falsehood
	2 Corinthians 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
	
6. Satan deceives
	2 Corinthians 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled(deceived) Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
	
	Revelation 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
	
7. Satan is the accuser of the brethren
	
The most pronounced strategy by satan is deception

Deceive: Deliberately cause someone to believe something that is not true, usually for personal gain / take advantage of.
Deception/falsehood: Statement / action that is intendeded to mislead, hide the truth / promote a false belief/idea. Often done for persol gain.

Deception can not happen untill the deceiver is aware of the truth

**Levels of satanic influence
1. Witchcraft: To cause you to think / act in error using the tool of deception
	Galatians 3:1 O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
	
	Ephesians 5:6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
	
	2 Peter 2:1-2 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

2. Manipulation and control of your mind
	Matthew 16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.
	But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.

	Luke 22:31-32 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
	But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
	
3. Possession: Complete influence and control of your spirit, mind and body
	Mark 5

**The biblical concept of deliverance**
Exodus 3:7-8 And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

Colossians 1:13-14 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

Deliverance: The scriptural strategy for experientally establishing the victory and authority of Jesus Christ over satan and demonic forces as it relates to the life and destiny of a believer

Deliverance and by extension spiritual warfare for the believer in Christ is about establishing and manifesting victory rather than fighting for it.

2 Corinthians 3:14 Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.

1 Corinthians 15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.


**Access points**
1. Covenants
2. Ignorance
3. Disobedience

**The nature of the flesh**
Unbeliever: Sin nature; nature of the devil
Believer: Self

**The levels of complete deliverance**
1. Casting out the spirit influences in your life and at the back of your challenges
2. Deliverance through transformation by the Word of God. It involves a re-orientation of your spiritual understanding, opening the believer to the nature and the character of God and then the principles of the kingdom.
Transformation closes the door of ignorance and empowers the believer to rise above the influence of demons
Transformation tears down negative thought patterns that hitherto were doorways for demons
3. The discipline of conformity: Compliance with standards; Adherence to scriptural instructions; Rescpect to the principleso of the kingdom. 
To conform you need:
	- The enabling grace
		Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me
	- Your will
		Philippians 3:12-16  Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
		Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
		I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
		Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
		Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.

How to conform:
	- Your words
		Proverbs 18:20-21  A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
		Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
	- Your decisions: Decisions decide destiny
		Deutoronomy 30-19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
		The quality of your choices and decisions will always be a reflection of your belief systems

4.The discipline to apply and live by the truths you've found
	John 13:17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if you do them
	

**Weapons of victory**
*The whole armour of God*
Ephesians 6:10-18
1. Truth - Integrity and moral courage
2. The breastplate of righteousness - An upright heart
3. Feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace - An awareness that while you are ready to preach the gospel there is an immunity that follows you
	Daniel 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
4. Shield of faith
5. Helmet of salvation - Understanding of your oneness with Christ and your positional advantage
	Ephesians 6:10  In conclusion, be strong in the Lord [draw your strength from Him and be empowered through your union with Him] and in the power of His [boundless] might.
6. The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God
7. Praying always

The whole armour of God are preventive strategies that help the believer maintain his victory

**Weapons that establish victory**
1. The Word of God
	Hebrews 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:
	Ecclesiasted 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
	Isaiah 55:11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.
	Psalm 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
	Mark 16:20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
	
	The Word of God activates the power of God
	
	1 John 2:14  I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
	
	1 John 5:14-15 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
	
2. The name of Jesus
	Mark 16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
	John 14:13-14 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
	If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

3. The blood
	Leviticus 17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
	
	Blood represents life. This life is in levels
	Blood has always been used as a ransom
	Blood has the power of appeasal
	
	Ephesians 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
	
	John 6:53-58  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
	Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
	For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
	He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
	As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
	This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
	
	1 Corinthians 11:23-  For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
	And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
	After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
