https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CI7EWnJ-l0&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Psalm 86:8-10 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.

We were created for God's glory.
  Isaiah 43:5-7 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
  I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;
  Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

It is the mandate and the responsibility of every believer to give God glory through their life.
  Psalm 86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.

Hebrew: Glory (Kavod / Kabod): Honor, respect, distinction, importance, the measure of the worth or the value of a person or a thing resulting in praise.
(The weightiness; the value of a thing)

Greek: Glory (Doxa): Radiance, splendour, concerned with manifestation, display or flaunting, make visible what was hidden so that people will see it.

Doxazo: To praise
        Extol
        Hold a person or a thing in honor
        Make reknown / make famous
        To make the dignity and the worth of a person or a thing to become manifest and acknowledged.

Doxazo is concerned with the revelation and the manifestation of the glory.
(Giving illumination to something even though glorious was not known; the revelation of the value of a thing)

## Channels for manifesting / revealing the glory of God
Jeremiah 9:23 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:

1. Wisdom: The intelligence of the Spirit flowing through a believer.
  There is a kind of wisdom that only those in Christ can have.
  Luke 1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the WISDOM OF THE JUST; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

  The proof of wisdom is the quality of the decisions that come out of your life.
  Wisdom is the correct scriptural application of truth.
  Wisdom is connected to mighty works. Ordinary men with mighty works in technology, business, ministry, e.tc
    Proverbs 24:3 Through [skillful and godly] wisdom a house [a life, a home, a family] is built, And by understanding it is established [on a sound and good foundation],

  You cannot fake the presence of wisdom. Your work implicates you. The absence of mighty works is the proof that wisdom is absent.
    Deuteronomy 34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.

    Luke 21:15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

    Colossians 1:9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

    Proverbs 8:18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.

    Wisdom is the vehicle that speed uses to run.

    ### How to access wisdom
    1. Prayer. You can cry unto God in prayer for wisdom.
    2. Light from scripture. The diligent study of scripture.
    3. Impartation fro proven carriers of the spirit of wisdom.

    Wisdom is enhanced through meditation. When you know how to meditate, to sit quietly and ponder, the spirit of wisdom begins to move.
 
2. Might / power
  You cannot manifest the glory of God without power. Spiritual supernatural power, intellectual power, power and might in all its ramifications.
  Power: The ability to produce results.
         The ability to compel compliance.
         The ability to compel desired outcomes.

3. Riches / wealth
  Genesis 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

  ### How resources come to a person.
  1. Value. Your value must be packaged, refined and served with excellence.
  2. Favour through relationships. You are as powerful as the relationships you have. You are as powerful as the men that stand by you even financially to support you.

## Platforms for ascribing glory to God.
1. Fruit bearing: Producing extra ordinary results.
  John 15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

  Ephesians 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

  Ephesians 3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

2. Longevity of impact (sustained impact).
  Psalm 3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.

  John 15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit SHOULD REMAIN: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

  Psalm 92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;

3. Testimonies and public declarations of His faithfulness.
  Psalm 22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.

  Psalm 92:1-4 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High:
  To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
  Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
  For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.

  Psalm 96:1-9 O sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
  Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
  Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
  For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
  For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.
  Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
  Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
  Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
  O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.

  John 2:9-10
