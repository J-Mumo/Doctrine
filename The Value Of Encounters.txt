** The Value Of Encounters **

The quality of your christian experience deppends on the kind of encounters you have.

Encounter: An experience that crystallize the reality of God in all of His dimensions to the believer.
Daniel 11:32b: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.

God reveals Himself to men dimensionally and the dimension of God you encounter becomes the direction of your exploits.
Exodus 6:1-3 Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:
And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.

The believers confidence is based  on your encounter with God.
An experience with God is the basis for your confidence in the kingdom.
Your life and your future will depend on the confidence that comes from your encounters.

** Levels of encounters you must press for consistently **
1. Encounters by the Word (Light from scripture)
  1 Samuel 3:21: And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.

  Himself means His power, wisdom, your prophetic blueprint in Him, favor
  Scripture on its own does not give you revelation
  Bible study is exploring scripture until an encounter is established
    Luke 4:17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he FOUND the place where it was written,
    Genesis 21:19 And God OPENED HER EYES, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
    Galatians 2:1-2 Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.
    And I WENT UP BY REVELATION, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

  Knowledge is not revelation
  Ephesians 1:17-18 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
  The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
  Ezekiel 2:1-2 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
  And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
  Psalm 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.

  The way to get light from scripture is to start by being a student of scripture
  John 5:38-39 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
  Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

2. Visionery encounters (Word based visionery encounters)
  Luke 24:18-32 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
  And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
  And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
  But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
  Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
  And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
  And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
  Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
  Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
  And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
  And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
  But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
  And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
  And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

 Three things we learn from this visionery encounter that becomes the litmus test
  1. The encounter was centered on Jesus and it brought them growth and understanding
    Luke 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

  2. The encounter did not violate scripture
    Luke 24:25-27 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
    Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
    And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

  3. The encounter affected their heats and passion
    Luke 24:29-32 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
    And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.
    And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
    And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

** Results you get from pressing for encounters **
1. An impartation of the spirit of faith.
  The confidence to live out your destiny
  The confidence to live out the purposes of God in your life
  The confidence to dare life without fear
  Daniel 3:15-30 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
  If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.
  But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
  Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
  And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
  Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
  Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
  And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
  Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
  Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
  And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
  Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
  Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

  Acts 4:29-31 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
  By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
  And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

2. Supernatural empowerment to demonstrate the might and the power of God to your world
  John 4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
  Romans 15:19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
  Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

3. Your exploits will cause men to glorify Jesus and believe in Him
  John 20:30-31 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

  Daniel 6:25-27 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
  I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
  He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
