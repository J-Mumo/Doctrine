https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVY1ekqUapg

Matthew 8:5-13 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,
And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.
And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.
But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.

Power: The capacity to influence outcomes.
       The force that compels compliance.

Authority: The right / legitimacy to use / administer power.
           The right to represent / stand instead for.
           Always comes with a predefined jurisdiction.

Jurisdiction: The sphere where the use of power is allowed beyond which it becomes illegal.

Man does not have absolute power.
Only God has absolute power and He is the owner of all power.
    1 Chronicles 29:11 Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.

    2 Chronicles 20:5-6 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court,
    And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

To walk in dominion, you must have power and authority.
    Luke 10:19 Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you.

## What is the jurisdiction for man to manifest power
Genesis 1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

1. You were given power over satan and all unclean spirits that function within the earth oppressing the saints.
    James 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

    Matthew 10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

2. Power to change negative circumstances like sicknesses, diseases, afflictions
    Matthew 8:27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!

    Matthew 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

3. Power to minister life.
    1 Corinthians 15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit (life giving spirit).

## How to manifest kingdom power and authority
The principal channel for releasing power and manifesting authority is through words.
    Mark 11:23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

    Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

    Matthew 8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: BUT SPEAK THE WORD ONLY, and my servant shall be healed.

## Assignment of power and authority
John 1:6-7 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

John 20:30-31 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

Acts 4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

1. To give witness to the Lordship of Jesus, bringing many to salvation.
2. To live a vitorious christian life on earth while serving the purposes of the kingdom.
3. To advance the course of the kingdom, God's agenda upon the earth.
