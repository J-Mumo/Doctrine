2 Kings 6:24-33 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.
So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what should I wait for the Lord any longer?
2 Kings 7:1 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.

The manifestation of the believers victory depends on:
1. Understanding
2. Engaging the systems of advantage that God has made available

Hebrews 4:9-11 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

Some systems of advantage:
1. Prayer
	Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
	1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.
	Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
	James 5:13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
2. The gift of men
	Exodus 3
	
3. Favour
	Exodus 3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
	
	Esther 2:15-17 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
	So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
	
	Psalm 44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
	
4. Speed - Dominion over time
	1 Kings 18:46 And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
	
5. Restoration
	Joel 2:25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
	Job 42:10 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
	
6. Skill and diligence
	Proverbs 22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
	Daniel 1:4 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
	Proverbs 13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.
	
7. The prophetic
	Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
	
	James 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
	
	Amos 3:7 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.
	
	Hosea 12:10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
	
	Hosea 12:13 And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
	
	There is the prophetic as an office, but there is the prophetic as an operation
	
	** Why is the prophetic powerful **
	1. Because the prophetic as a unique ability to exact dominion over time
	2. The prophetic can create supernatural possibilities and schedule them in your present and future. 
		To create means to make manifest in the world of men. To give spiritual realities material expression
		
		Genesis 1:26-28
		2 Kings 5:1-14
		2 Kings 5:10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
		2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
		
		John 2:7-11 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
		And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
		When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
		And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
		This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
		
		John 11:41-44 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
		And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
		And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
		And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
		
	Two principle channels for accessing the prophetic
	1. Scripture
		2 Peter 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
		John 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
		Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
		
	2. A human vessel in patnership with the Holy Spirit
		John 16:12-14 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
		Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
		He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
		
		I Corinthians 2:10-12 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
		For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
		Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
		
	Accuracy of the human vessel depends on:
	1. Level of concencration and yieldedness of the vessel
		Leviticus 19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.
		Leviticus 20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
		Acts 16:16-18
		
	2. The kind of association the vessel has.
	3. Your level of transformation and enlightenment
		Mark 8:22-25 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
		And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
		And he looked up, and said, I SEE MEN AS TREES, WALKING.
		After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
		
	4. Level of character and sincerity of the vessel
		Jeremiah 14:14  Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
	5. Your capacity to inteprete the things you see and hear. The strength of your ability to interprete.
		Matthew 17:1-4 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,
		And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
		And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.
		Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
		
	** How to engage the prophetic for victory **
	1. Scripture
		a. You must acces the prophetic blessing of scripture by locating scriptiural promises that relate to your area of concern
		Luke 4:17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
		
		b. Declare it boldly
			Psalm 107:2 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
			Numbers 14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
			Hebrews 10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
			
		c. Obediently fulfil the conditions tied to the manifestation
			Deuteronomy 28:1-2 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
			And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.
			Isaiah 1:19-20 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
			But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
			
		d. Remain steadfast, giving thanks
			Romans 4:20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
			
	2. From vessels
		a. Discernment
			John 4:19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
			2 Kings 4:8-9 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
			And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.
			
		b. Honor
			2 Kings 4:10-13 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
			And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
			And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
			And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
			
			1 Samuel 9:6-8 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.
			Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
			And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
			
		3. Faith
			2 Chronicles 20:20 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
			
			John 2:5-8 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
			And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
			Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
			And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
