Philippians 4:19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

And God is able to make all grace (every favor and [a]earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need [b]be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].

Jireh is an expression of the fatherhood of God. It expresses his willingness to supply all that is needed by the believer.

When it comes to riches, wealth and abundance, there are 5 categories of people:
1. Those with an unholy obsession for anything money and wealth without a kingom purpose attached.
2. Those with a total disdain for anything money and wealth. They have a wrong mental construct concerning the topic.
3. Those who have sincerly embraced God's perspective of wealth and abundance, even understand it's purpose but do not have the requisite knowledge to manifest it and make abundance a reality in their lives.
4. Those who believe in wealth, abundance and propsperity from a responsible kingdom standpoint. They understand its role, purpose and the dynamics of being and staying wealthy.
5. Those who neither oppose the subject of wealth and abundance nor intentionally embrace it.

Our world is economically driven. It takes having abundant financial resources to fulfil your dreams and goals, to advance God's program on earth, to be a blessing.

The absence of financial resources will cripple any life, vision and tamper with the advancement of God's program.

The starting point of every financial journey is to have an awareness that:
1. It is the will of God for you and I to prosper financially.
  Psalm 35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

  Deuteronomy 8:18 But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

2. You must believe that wealth and abundance is one of the blessings that come with loving and serving Jesus.
  Job 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

3. You can have abundant financial resources without knowing or loving the Lord but the peace that comes with it only comes from God.
  John 14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

4. Wealth and abundance in the kingdom is a function if laws, human factors, divine empowerment and the help of God.

5. God does not decide who becomes wealthy or who remains poor.
  Deuteronomy 30:19-20 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
  That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

6. Kingdom wealth is not just about being a millionaire / billionaire but having sufficient supplies that meet your needs, funds your assignments, funds God's program and to be a blessing and make a difference in the world.

## The tripatite expression of poverty.
1. Spirit: It works by creating occurences that hinder abundance or deplete any available finance, e.g, mysterious sicknesses, mysterious events that lead to losses (robbery, accidents)
  Luke 8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,

  Luke 10:30-35 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
  And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
  And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
  But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,
  And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
  And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

2. Mindset: It programs you so that you make self destructive decisions.

  And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
  And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.

  Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

  And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
  And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

  Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
  I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
