	Proverbs 14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.
	Proverbs 27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?

	Proverbs 6:16-19 These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
	A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
	
3. Avoid offense: Ease you get agitated/angry

4. Practise forgiveness
	Ephesians 4:32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's
	sake hath forgiven you.

	shall be forgiven:

	even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

	1 John 4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his 
	brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
