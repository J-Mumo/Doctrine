https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocbHJl6z0QU&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Matthew 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

Knowledge: A cordinated gathering of information.
Understanding: The working dynamics captured in knowledge.
Wisdom: Engaging what you understand, the correct application.

John 13:17 Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

Romans 8:6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

1 Corinthians 2:14-16 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ.

1. The carnal man: 
  - This one is already a believer.
  - There is absence of transformation by the Word of God
  - Such a person is still alive to self
  Romans 8:6-8 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
  Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
  So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

  ### The danger of carnality:
  1. Your life becomes a continous representation of the image of Christ.
  2. Your experience in terms of results and that of an unbeliever will be the same.
    1 Corinthians 3:1-4 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
    I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
    For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
    For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?

    Ephesians 2:1-3 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
    Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
    Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

  ### What a carnal man should do
  Submit to the ministry of the Word through a teaching priest.

2. The natural man
  1 Corinthians 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

3. The spiritual man
  - Must have encountered Christ through the new birth experience.
  - Has had an experience with the person and the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
  - Has a thorough comprehension of the principles of the kingdom as revealed in scripture.
  - Willing to submit to transformation by the Word of God.
    Romans 12:1-2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
    And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

    Philippians 2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

  To know you are led by the Holy Spirit, there is nothing He will tell you that is by force.

  Ephesians 4:10-13 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
  And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
  For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
  Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

  ### The formation of Christ
  1. The nature of Christ
    Galatians 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
    Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

    1 Corinthians 13:1-7 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.
    And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
    And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body [a]to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.
    Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not [b]puffed up;
    does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, [c]thinks no evil;
    does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
    bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things

  2. The mind / the wisdom of Christ
    Philippians 2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

    1 Corinthians 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

    Luke 1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

  3. The works of Christ
    Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

    John 20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

    Luke 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,

    A spiritual man is one who has walked with the Spirit of God to be able to embrace and inculcate within himself in experience the nature of Christ, manifesting by submission to the Word (the wisdom of Christ) and who by the Spirit of grace is demonstrating the works of Christ the chiefest being global evangalization.
