1. Wisdom
2. Faith
3. Power

Acts 6:7-10 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.

### The potency of word derived faith
Matthew 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

### Manifesting the promises of God (bible faith in victory and dominion)
1. Genuinely connected to God through salvation
  When we are saved:
  - We are born of God
    John 1:13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

  - Born of the Spirit
    John 3:3-6 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
    Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
    Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
    That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

  - Born of the incorruptible seed of God's word
    1 Peter 1:23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

  Salvation comes by hearing and believing the gospel og salvation
  1 Corinthians 15:1-10

  Romans 10:8-10

2. Have a thorough knowledge of the promises of God and principles of the kingdom
  You must understand the extent of God's commitment to you alongside the dynamics of activating that commitment.
  2 Peter 1:4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

  Job 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?

3. You must understand the concept of the will of God and the plan of God for your life.
  God is not commited to bringing just any desire to pass.
  Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

  ### Do not use scripture to satisfy lust
  Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
  Psalm 145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.

  Our confidence in our faith work is a by product of knowing that we are in the will of God.
    Colossians 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

  Until your desires and expectations align with God's will and plan for your life, He is not comitted to bringing them to pass.

4. Prayer
  Levels of prayer when you want to manifest bible faith
  - Verify the will of God: the prayer of inquiry. 
    Never take any major destiny defining step in your life without praying.
  - Prayer as your partnership in birthing the known will of God in your life.

5. Complete obedience
  2 Corinthians 10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

  Deuteronomy 28:1-2 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
  And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

  Joshua 1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
