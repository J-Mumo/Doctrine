Joshua 14:6-12 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.
Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.
Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the Lord my God.
And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God.
And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said.

Hebrews 6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

Men are as powerful as the God that backs them.
Men are as powerful as the mystries that back them.

Outlast: To continue to exist inspite of.
         To remain active.
         To last longer than things, opponents and conditions usually unfavourable.

## Keys to outlast
1. To be strong in the Lord.
  Ephesians 6:10 In conclusion, be strong in the Lord [be empowered through your union with Him]; draw your strength from Him [that strength which His boundless might provides].

  Your confidence in life will be on the strength of your knowledge of God.

  Everytime things get hard, look up unto Jesus; don't look down, look up.

2. Submit to the supremacy of the Word as final authority over your life in any and all matters.
  It is dangerous to build your life and your destiny on any other factor / foundation aside the Word of God.

  Psalm 18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

  Matthew 7:24-25 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

3. Build inner strength and stamina through consistent prayer.
  Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

  Proverbs 24:10 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

4. Be joful, void of bitterness and offence.

  ### Keys to remaining in joy

    James 1:2-4 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
    Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
    But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

  2. When you go through any unfavourable season, focus on the goodness of God.

  Joy is one of the greatest demonstration of faith.
  1 Peter 1:8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:

  Luke 9:62 But Jesus told him, “Anyone who puts a hand to the plow and then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God.”
