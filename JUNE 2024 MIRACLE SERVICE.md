Psalm 14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

Supernatural answers and solutions do not just appear, they are received.

### Understanding you need to receive from God.
1. Believe all lasting help comes from God and God alone
  Psalm 121:1-2 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
  My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

  Psalm 60:11-12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
  Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

  2 Kings 5:5-7 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
  And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
  And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

  Psalm 127:1-2 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
  It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

2. Know that God is a loving Father and He is a giver.
  Luke 11:13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

  Romans 8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

  James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

3. We receive answers from God first by asking in prayer.
  Psalm 34:17 The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.

  Matthew 7:8 For every one that asketh receiveth; ...

  1 John 5:14-15 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
  And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

  John 16:24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

  Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

4. The physical delivery and manifestation of our answers happens primarily through the ministry of men.
  You receive from two kinds of men:
  - Vessels ordained by God. The speak over your life, they bring prophetic instructions.
    1 Samuel 1:10-20 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore.
    And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
    And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth.
    Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
    And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
    And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.
    Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
    Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
    And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
    And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.
    Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord.

    John 5:5-11 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
    When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
    The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
    Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
    And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
    The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
    He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

  - Helpers of destiny.
