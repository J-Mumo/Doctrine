Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

God rewards: 
1. A diligent pursuit for Him and the things of the spirit
2. Faithfulness
3. The works of men: - The purity of the motivation
					 - Degree of compliance in divine patterns
