** Doctrine Of Power **

** Levels of power **
1 Corinthians 12:6-11 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
**Prophetic gifts **
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
** Power gifts **
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits;
**** 
to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

** Kinds of power **
1. Alke: The kind of power that makes you lead and affect society / territory

2. Anakazo: The compelling power: It compells compliance
	Isaiah 2:3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
	
	You get anakazo by staying under the cloud
	It comes upon you as you stay in God's presence

3. Energeo: Gives the ability to work a dimension

4. Exousia: Delegated authority. It is related to a position. 
	The authority to will the authority of another.
	Born out of the revelation of who you are in Christ and what Christ has done for you
	It works when revelation hits you
	Create an atmosphere where the proceeding Word is constant

5. Dunamis: Inherent power. The ability to create change
	Comes when you receive the Holy Spirit
	It is a potential power
	For it to work, you have to engage it by prayer
	It is momentary, you must stir it
	For dumanis you pray through
	The foundation of dunamis is kratus

6. Ischus: It is tied to the degree of your submission to the authority you are hoping light comes from
	Character and track record of righteousness is a weapon
	2 Corinthians 10:6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

7. Kratos: Ephesians 6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
	Power to create change
	Engaged by praying consistently
	It is eternal (not momentary)

8. Megatose: Quantifies the outcomes of your manifestation. (Mighty power, great power)
	
	
Alke: Power for leaders
	Power for building systems
	It is the power to reign
	It confers upon you pre-eminence
	** How to engage this power **
	1. Have a revelational understanding of the name of Jesus and spiritual weapons (The Blood of Jesus) and how to use them.
		The name of Jesus has a saving dimension and a ruling dimension.
		
		Matthew 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.
		Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
		
		Philippians 2:9-10 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
		That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
		Romans 13:14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
		The way to wear this name is to know it until it becomes your life
		Ephesians 4:24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
		
		Revelation 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
		The invinsibility of the Blood is activated when you begin to break bread regularly.
		The Blood has the mystrey of excemption
		
** Operating in power by virtue **
1. Brokenness (Includes humility & meekness)
	Psalm 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
	
2. Purity
	Daniel 1:8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
	Daniel 5:11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;
	
	Genesis 39:9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
	Psalm 105:17-22 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
	Until the time that his word came: the word of the Lord tried him.
	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
	
	Hebrews 1:9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
	2 Corinthians 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
	Isaiah 52:11 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.
	2 Timothy 2:20-21 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.
	
3. Reverence for God / The fear of the Lord
	Isaiah 11:2-3 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
	And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
	
	Job 1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
	1 Samuel 2:30 Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
	
4. Love
	John 21:15-16 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest(Phileo) thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
	He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest(Agape) thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
	
** Power by spiritual elements **
These cause you to walk in all the dimensions of power
They work because it is God's sovereignity that permits you to work in them

1. Sacrifice
	Psalm 126 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
	The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
	Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
	He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
	
	Genesis 22 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
	...
	And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
	That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
	
	John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
	
	1 Kings 3 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
	In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
	...
	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
	Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
	
	2 Kings 3:18&27 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
	
	When you master sacrifice, God moves it to covenant. When it becomes a covenant it becomes a lifestyle. A covenant is more powerful than covenant
	Psalm 89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
	
	Covenant of purity: Job 31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
	Covenant of service: 1 Corinthians 9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
	Covenant of honor: 2 Samuel 24:24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
	Covenant of prayer: Daniel 6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
	
2. Obedience
	1 Sam. 15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
