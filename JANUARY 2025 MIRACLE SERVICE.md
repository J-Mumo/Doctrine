### The dynamics of receiving
1. Define your expectations

  Ephesians 1:3

3. Declare that it is done by faith
  2 Corinthians 4:13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

4. Listen for and obey the instructions that follow
  Luke 17:11-14 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
  And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
  And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
  And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

5. Give quality thanks, believing you have received.
  Luke 17:15-16 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
  And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

  Psalm 69:30-31 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
  This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
