https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x95_8A0ykLc&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

## Reasons you should believe in the concept of greater works
1. Jesus Christ said so
  Numbers 23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

2. The believer has been given authority through Christ
  Matthew 28:18-20 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

  Luke 10:19 Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

  Ephesians 2:6And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

3. Access to the Spirit of God
  Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

  Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

## Reasons Jesus used the word greater
1. While Jesus walked upon the earth, he largely did what he did alone. But today all believers can carry out this mandate and have access to the Spirit bringing greater efficiency.
  John 12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

2. Inspite of the many miracles Jesus performed while on earth, there was one miracle, which was the greatest need of man he could not perform.
   He could not give eternal life before he died.
   Colossians 1:12-14 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
   Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
   In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

   Colossians 1:19-20 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
   And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

   Ephesians 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

## Ultimate goal of greater works
The knowldege of the glory of God fills the entire earth drawing many to Jesus.
  Habakkuk 2:14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

  Isaiah 40:5 And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

  John 4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

  John 20:30-31 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

  Daniel 3:28-29 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

## Spiritual forces that must be engaged for every believer to walk in the experience of greater works
1. The force of prayer. How to use prayer as a tool to birth and establish the purposes og God across a territory
  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

2. The force of wisdom
  Mark 6:2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

  James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

  Isaiah 11:2 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

  Wisdom: The accurate application of spiritual knowledge
          The supernatural ability to use the written and inspired Word of God to make accurate decisions and provide solutions to life's problems

  ### 4 kinds of wisdom
  James 3:13-17 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

  1. Earthly wisdom, common sense, instincts. The natural ability to respond to right and wrong
  2. Sensual wisdom / scientific wisdom: Wisdom that comes through study, science, philosophy
  3. Devilish / demonic wisdom: A sense of recognizing right and wrong by demonic motivations
  4. Wisdom from above: Godly supernatural wisdom
    1 Corinthians 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

     Luke 1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

     Daniel 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
