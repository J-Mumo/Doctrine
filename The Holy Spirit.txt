Who is the Holy Spirit?

1. The Holy Spirit is God
	He deserves worship, honour, trust
	
2. The Holy Spirit represents the unlimited presence of Jesus
	John 14:16-17 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
	Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; 
	for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
	
3. The Wisdom of God

4. The Revealer of the presence and power of God
	The Holy Spirit makes the presence and power of God real to men.
	Without the Holy Spirit, no matter what miracle you see, it cannot change you
	
5. The Author of scripture
	2 Peter 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by 
	the Holy Ghost.
	2 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, 
	for instruction in righteousness:
	
**The Ministry of The Holy Spirit**

John 16:7-15 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, 
	the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
	Of sin, because they believe not on me;
	Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
	Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; 
	but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
	He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
	All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
	
Assignment of the Holy Spirit to men:
1. Ministry to unbelievers
	John 15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, 
	which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:
	The Holy Spirit convicts and draws the heart of unbelievers to Jesus

2. Ministry to the body of Christ
	The ministry of the Holy Spirit is primarily carried out through communion / fellowship
	
	2 Corinthians 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
	
	Philippians 2:1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
	
	1. Activation of his spiritual senses
		1 Corinthians 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
		- The things of the Spirit do not become an embarrassment
		
	2. Revelation and understanding of scripture
		The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Revelation and Understanding
		Ephesians 1:17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him:

	3. Guidance and direction
		John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
		Isaiah 30:21 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
		Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
			He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
			He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
			Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
			Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

	4. Renewal and transformation
		2 Corinthians 3:18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
		Romans 12:2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.
		
		You are transformed by scripture only when the breathe of the Holy Spirit is upon it.
		
		Galatians 5:22-25 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
		Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
		And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
		If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
		
	5. Empowerement
		Isaiah 61:1-4
		Acts 1:8
		Acts 10:38
		The Holy Spirit is the custodian of the annointing.
		Empowerement is causing God's ability to work in and through you.

1 Corinthians 3:9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

	The love of God: An expression of the benevolent nature of God, an expression of His generousity.
		The Love of God is revealed in Jesus Christ and substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus
	The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Generic term used to express any and everything that comes from God.
	The communion of the Holy Ghost:
	The Holy Spirit fathered Jesus
	The Holy Spirit birthed the church
	The Holy Spirit has a definite form. The reason He does not reveal His form is because He wants Jesus to be glorified
	
	Christianity is not a religion
	Christianity is an experience
	Christianity is a revelation

	Religion is man's attempt to:
	- Manage his confusion about God
	- Find God without the agency of the Holy Spirit
	- Create an explanation of the realm of the spirit and the dealings of God, without the Holy Spirit
	- Product of man's pride, his refusal to accept there is God but accepts that the realm of the spirit is real		

**The Ministry of The Spirit**
Mark 16:20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, 
	and confirming the word with signs following. Amen
Isaiah 48:16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; 
	from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

1. The Ministry of the Spirit is a revelation on how a believer through fellowship and patnership
   with the Holy Spirit will produce extraordinary results giving glory to God.
	John 15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

	The first proof you are working with the Holy Spirit is your submission to His leadership.

2. Walking in the might, the power and the grace of the Spirit
	John 3:2  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a 
		teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
		
	Acts 19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
	
	Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses 
		unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
		
	2 Corinthians 6:1 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
	
	Daniel 11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: 
		but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
		
	Zechariah 4:6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, 
		Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
