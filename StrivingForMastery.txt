**Striving For Mastery**

1 Corinthians 8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

2 Timothy 2:5 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.

Genesis 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
What makes a day is the appearance of light.
When a man has light he has entered his day.

**The spirituality of life**
Life and living is spiritual.

Romans 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

2 Corinthians 4:18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

Hebrews 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

The realm of the spirit governs the physical
You must master the keys that translate spiritual realities into physical manifestations

**Keys to attaining mastery**
1. Understanding prayer
	* Assignments of prayer
	- Growth and transformation
	  Luke 9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
	  Jude 1:20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost
	- Making requests and obtaining promises
	  Philippians 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
	- Spiritual legislation (Decrees, creating possibilities)
	  Job 22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
	  Numbers 14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:
	- Warfare and intercession
	  Ezekiel 22:29-31 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
	  And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
	  Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord God.
	  
	Most effective dimension of prayer:
	1. Praying in the Spirit
	2. Praying the promises of God
		Isaiah 41:21 Produce your cause, saith the Lord; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.
		Approach prayer like a legal system in the realm of the spirit
		Bring the Word of God to Him in prayer. The spiritual basis that commits Him to move on that wise.
		
2. Understanding and engaging the laws and the principles of the kingdom
	Matthew 16:19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind (declare to be improper and unlawful) on earth [a]must be what is already bound in heaven; and whatever you loose (declare lawful) on earth [b]must be what is already loosed in heaven.
	Luke 11:52 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.
	Leviticus 9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.
	Psalm 25:4-5 Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.
	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
	Exodus 33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
	
	1. The sacrifice of total surrender
		2 Corinthians 5:14-15  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
		And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
		Matthew 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
		*-* Die to self
		- You must be free from sin and free from self
		- The ability to not say no to God
		- Everything in your name and of you, give to God.
		
	2. The law of mental transformation
		Proverbs 23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: ...
		
	3. The law of value and contribution
		
	4. The law of authority
		You are as powerful as your relationship with the authority that sends you.
		James 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
		
		Authority provides provision, protection & promotion
		
		Matthew 8: 9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it
		
		Daniel 11:32b: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits

		Mark 11:22-24: And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith on God.
			For verily I say unto you, That whatsoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.
			Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them
			
		Faith is obedience. Obedience to the scriptural demands that commit God over the affairs of your life.
		
	6. The law of relationships
		Remember Lot and Abraham
		1. General relationships
		2. Seasonal relationships: The key to receiving from this relationship is discernment as they are not there forever.
		3. Covenant / destiny relationships. You must protect at all costs
		
		Be fruitful means be relational
		
	7. The law of honor
		Honor: The discerning, celebrating and rewarding of men because of their value and their uniqueness.
		
		Why people fail: Dishonor to God, men & principals
		
		Honor is the key for access. 
		Dishonor closes doors.
		
	8. The law of favour
		1 Samuel 16:21-22 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer
		And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.
		
		Favour is when God annoints people to participate in my success. When they provide the leverage of their credibility, their resources to help me rise.
		
		Proverbs 13:15 Good uderstanding giveth favour; but the way of the transgressor is hard.
		
	9. The law of spiritual empowerment
		 Luke 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath annointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
		 

3. Systems and structures
	A system is a set of elements/components that are organized for a common purpose,
	A set of principals/procedures according to which something is done,
	An organized approach
	A structure means to fit together / build
	Structure means the way in which parts of a system are arranged
	No growth process/result is sustainable until and unless it is systemized
	To systemize means to make the outcome predictable by generating a formula
	
	Advantages of system and structures
	1. Make it possible for everyone who engages them to have the same / similar results.
	2. Minimize biases and sentiments
	3. Gaurantee sustainability and longivity of results
	4. Make replication possible
	5. Provide a basis for commendation, correction, promotion, demotion without biases or emotional interference.
	
	Systems for an individual

	2. Operational guide based on convictions and priorities
	
	Systems for an organization
	1. Compendium of the systems and modus operandi that run the organization and use it to train your staff / workforce
	
	How to build formidable systems and structures
	1. Why do I exist? Clear definition of vision, goal to be achieved and end product
	2. Who are the beneficiaries of my solutions ..?
	3. What tools do I need?
	4. Who does what?
	5. What is the most important aspect of the vision to focus on now?
	6. What are the major limitations, pitfalls and distractions to avoid
		1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour
		
	You must build a code of conduct and operation around the answers to the above questions
