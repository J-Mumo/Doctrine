https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6sVyY-hj10&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

1 Chronicles 12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.
Revelation 3:22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

## 4 major prophetic activities that represent the current emphasis and the focus of God in this season
1 Corinthians 2:9-10 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

Isaiah 40:9-11 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.

Matthew 10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

1. Purifying of the church. Judgement in the house of God
  1 Peter 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?

  2 Timothy 2:20-21 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.

  Daniel 5:27 Tekel; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.

  How does God purify the saints
  John 15:2-3 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

  Ephesians 5:13-14 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
  Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

  ### Areas the church is being purified
  1. Moral decadence
  2. Apostecy: A deviation from the truth
  3. Error: Largely as a result of ignorance and imbalance
    Matthew 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
  Especially the prophetic and apostolic ministry

2. Enlightenment: An abundance of revelation
  1. Restoration to doctrine
    1 Timothy 4:13-16 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
    Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
    Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
    Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.

  2. Correcting the error of imbalance
    Acts 18:24-28 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
    This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
    And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
    And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
    For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

    Acts 20:27-32 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
    Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
    For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
    Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
    Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
    And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.

    Colossians 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

  3. Connecting revelation to divine purpose

  4. Redefinitions. Redefining concepts, redifning ideas
    1. God is redefining the gospel
    2. Redefining the great commission
    3. Redefining revival
    4. The concept of being light, salt, witness, an ambassodor

3. Access to greater and unusual dimensions of spiritual power
  Joel 2:23-24 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.
  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

  Because of this, God is submitting people through intense spiritual exercises to enlarge their capacity to receive.
  Matthew 9:16-17 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
  Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

4. Divine commissionings - Heavenly callings, mandates and assignments that will be given to men
  - The woman at the well
  - The mad man at Gathara
  John 15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

  Matthew 10:16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

  Luke 8:1-3 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,
  And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
  And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

5. An upgrade in current mandates and assignments
  Acts 26:16-19 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;
  Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
  To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
  Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:

  There is always more to your calling than what you initially see
