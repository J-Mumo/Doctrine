2 Corinthians 12:8-9 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

2 Peter 1:2-4 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

2 Corinthians 3:5-6 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

Ephesians 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath BLESSED us with ALL SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS in heavenly places in Christ:

Grace: All spiritual blessings that have been given to the believer to live life of victory but can be accessed only through the office of the Christ

** 2 dimensions of grace **
1. Saving grace
	Titus 2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
	
2. Enabling Grace
	Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
	Ephesians 6:10 In conclusion, be strong in the Lord [draw your strength from Him and be empowered through your union with Him] and in the power of His [boundless] might.
	
	The enabling grace comes and grows through revelation knowledge
	2 Peter 1:2-4 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord
	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
	
	The key to abundance of grace is access to high level spiritual illumination that is backed up by a life of prayer and fellowship with the HolySpirit.
	Ephesians 1:18 And [I pray] that the eyes of your heart [the very center and core of your being] may be enlightened [flooded with light by the Holy Spirit], so that you will know and cherish the [a]hope [the divine guarantee, the confident expectation] to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the [b]saints (Godâ€™s people),
	
	2 Corinthians 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.
