**Activating Possibilities**

1. The Law of Faith:
	Numbers 23:19  God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: 
	hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
	
	- Encounter with the Word of God
	- Meditation that brings understanding. It shows you the role that you have to play. The Word must be 
	  settled in your heart / spirit. You don't find it and start running
	- Actions of obedience
	
2. The Law of Favour
	- Honour: Discerning, celebrating and rewarding of men for their uniqueness
	- Value: A measure of your usefuleness
	- The Esther annointing
	- Favour provoking prayers
