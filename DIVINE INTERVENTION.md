Exodus 3:7-9 And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

Divine intervention is when God steps in over the affairs and the issues of our lives, influencing circumstances and situations to turn out for the good of His people. It is usually an act of deliverance from negative circumstances and conditions.
God does this as an act of His mercy, love and sovereign power.

### Why do we need divine intervention
There are certain situations and circumstances we find ourselves in that are beyond our ability as humans to influence / change.
These circumstances can be caused by:
- Ignorance
- Human factors beyond our control
- Demonically engineered

Deuteronomy 26:6-9 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:
And when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers, the Lord heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression:
And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:
And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.
