** Opening Destiny Doors Through Relationships **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7ZZiGDy0so

Luke 11:5-10 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.
And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

Proverbs 13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.

Matthew 4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

Destiny fullfilment and advancement is practically impossible without relationships and strategic connections.

Relationships are bridges to an exceptional life, they are also bridges to a life of pain and regret.

Relationships are currencies. They can buy what money can buy & they can buy what money cannot buy.

** Dimensions of relationships that must be at work in your life **
1. Relationship with God
	Matthew 22:37-40 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
	This is the first and great commandment.
	And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
	
	Proverbs 23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
	
	2 Chronicles 15:12-15 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
	That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
	And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.
	
	Matthew 19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
	
2. Relationship with men
	Psalm 8:1-6 O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
	
	Psalm 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
	
	John 5:1-8 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
	And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
	When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
	Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
	
	You must understand the principals of sustainable relationships in order to excel in your life and destiny.
	
	**  **
	1. Who hates you does not matter, but in this kingdom who likes you matters.
	2. Men are ladders and men can provide a leverage to your life and destiny.
	3. God will always use men for your rising, satan will always use men for your falling/destruction.
	4. Relationships are INVESTMENTS.
	5. No man will ever outgrow the influence that comes from men.
	
	** Keys to help maintain relationships **
	1. Rise above competitive jealousy
		Proverbs 14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.
		
	2. Avoid evil speaking / backbiting
	
	3. Practise forgiveness and tolerance
	
	4. Be an active contributor to the growth of the relationship.
	
	5. Master kindness(The quality of being friendly, generous and considerate) and hospitality(Intrinsic desire to see people happy and welcomed).
	
3. Relationship with things
	1 Timothy 6:17-21 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:
	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
	
	1 John 2:15-16 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
