** The Power Of Testimonies **
Psalms 22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
Psalms 107:31 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!

Mark 4:35-41 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

Storm: A violent disturbance of the atmosphere with strong winds, rain, thunder and lightenings.
       A disturbance of the normal condition of the atmosphere.

A storm affects:
- vision: your ability to see far
- visibility: the ability of others to see you
- voice
- movement & speed
- bring fear and discouragement
- losses and pain

Jonah 1:5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
Jonah 1:10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.

In dealing with storms, rebuking the wind / spirit should be your first action.
Storms are made of 2 elements:
1. Wind: The invisible part of the situation
2. Water: The visible situation
Mark 4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
We deal with storms by rebuking the wind then speaking to the water

Jesus being in your boat doesn't automatically bring deliverance
Jesus in your boat is hope that you will not be lost
It takes your effort, humility, to wake Jesus
The Lord is nigh them that call upon Him, not them that are aware He is there. It will always take faith.
Proverbs 3:5-6 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

The power to prosper comes to three areas:
1. Head: Illumination and direction
2. Hands: Productivity
3. Feet: Direction and speed
