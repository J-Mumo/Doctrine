** This Grace Called Favour **

2 Corinthians 8:7 Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.

Lord give me wisdom.
Lord give me favour.
Lord give me the annointing of the Holy Spirit.

Exodus 3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

Exodus11:3 And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

Favour: Divine help / divine assistance - God in partnership with men providing help and assistance to your life and your destiny

Proverbs 13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.

The favour of God is the number one reason why people succeed in the kingdom
Luke 2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

Every testimony of victory and success in this kingdom is connected to favour.
In this kingdom who hates you does not matter, but who likes you matters
All blessings come from God, through men, to men
You need favour to achieve your goals and to live out your divine destiny in Christ

Favour is when God raises men to invest their time, their resources, their credibility in you.
One man can be used by God to open more than 100 doors of opportunities for you

The good understanding that brings favour:
1. Honour: The discerning, celebrating, the rewarding of men for their distinctive difference
	The cheapest way to practice honour is thanksgiving
	Romans 13:7 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 

2. Value: A measure of your usefulness through your ability to provide solutions within a context of a civilization.
	You know your valuable by how people inconvenience themselves to meet you
	Focus on developing yourself more than the business plan. Become the value
	You become successful by who you become more than what you are doing
	Your solutions have to be needed and useful
	Proverbs 22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
	Proverbs 18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
	You value has gotten to its prime when the audience / recepients are kings
	Lord You are the King of Kings and I want to be so valuable before You.
	
3. Relationships: Be fruitful means be relational
	- Advantageous connections
	Amos 3:3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
	
	When God lifts you, use it as a leverage to build relationships
	
	** People you need **
	1. Divine connectors: They can't help you, but they know who can help you and can connect you to them
	2. Men of influence: They are willing to invest their credibility and track record to help you rise
	3. Gifted people: Men and women who produce results
	4. Burden bearers: They stop you from going backward
	
4. Prayer: Ask Jabez
	1 Chronicles 4:10 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.
	
5. The Esther annointing
	Esther 2:15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her. 
	Esther 2:17  And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
