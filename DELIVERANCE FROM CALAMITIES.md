Psalm 20:1-5 The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.

God has the power to bring supernatural delivarance and restoration from negative situations.
Psalm 74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

1. Job 1:1-11 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
  And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
  And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
  And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
  Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.
  And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
  And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
  Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
  Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
  But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.

  Job 42:10-17 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
  Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
  So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
  He had also seven sons and three daughters.
  And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
  And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
  After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
  So Job died, being old and full of days.

2. Isaiah 38:1-9 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.
  Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the Lord,
  And said, Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
  Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,
  Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
  And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.
  And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken;
  Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
  The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:

  Isaiah 38:16-20 O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.
  Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
  For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
  The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.
  The Lord was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.

3. Jonah 1:1-15 Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
  Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
  But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.
  But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
  Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
  So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.
  And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
  Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
  And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.
  Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.
  Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.
  And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
  Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.
  Wherefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.
  So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.
  Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows.

  Jonah 2:10 And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

3. Daniel 3
  Daniel 3:24-30 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
  Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
  And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
  Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
  Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.

Calamity: A great misfortune / disaster.
          An event marked by great loss, distress and suffering.

## Causes of calamities, losses and tragedies
1. Absence of discernment
  Hebrews 2:1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.

  Isaiah 1:3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

  Acts 28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

  ### How to build discernment
  1. The knowledge of the ways of God as revealed in scripture
  2. Praying in the spirit

2. Carelessnes
  Hebrews 2:3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;

  Judges 11:30-35 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
  Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
  So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands.
  And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
  And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
  And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I cannot go back.

3. Ignorance of the laws of the spirit, of destiny
  Proverbs 19:2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

4. Misuse and abuse
  When the purpose of a thing is not known, abuse is inevitable

  ### 3 ways to protect everything God gives you
  1. Pray
    You keep anything God gives you by praying for it

  2. Gratitude

  3. Become an active contributer to that overall process

5. Demonic and satanic attacks
  John 10:10a The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:

  He stills years, destinies, relationships, convictions, discernment, ability to see, resources

## Keys for total deliverance
You need to know the will of God and the strategy to bring that will to pass.
It is God's will plus God's strategy that brings God's dimension of results.

Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

1. Self examination
  Luke 15:17-20 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
  I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
  And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
  And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

2. Brokenness
  Psalm 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

3. Prophetic intervention
  Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

  Isaiah 42:22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.
