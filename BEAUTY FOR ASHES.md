# BEAUTY FOR ASHES
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ5f2S1I3gU

Isaiah 61:1-3 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.

Tragedies and unpleasant conditions are real.
For the believer in Christ:
  Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

  Romans 8:18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

  2 Corinthians 4:8-10 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
  Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
  Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

  2 Corinthians 4:17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

  James 1:2-4 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
  Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
  But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

## Keys to replace ashes with beauty
1. Remain consious of the love of God towards you.
  Jeremiah 31:3 The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

  Romans 8:32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

  2 Corinthians 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

  Refuse to be offended with God.
  Matthew 11:1-6 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.
  Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
  And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
  Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:
  The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
  And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

2. Always hope and expect God's best in everything.
  Psalm 42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.

  Romans 5:5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

  ### Levels of hope
  - Hope in the midst of current situation.
  - Hope against hope.
    Romans 4:18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.

  - Eternal / blessed hope.

3. Never loose your joy.
  Habakkuk 3:17-18 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
  Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

  Nehemiah 8:10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.

  Philippians 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice.

4. Never stop believing and engaging the word og God.
  2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

  Hebrews 6:13-15 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
  Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
  And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

5. Pray without ceasing.
  Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

  Psalms 18:6 In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.

6. Stay connected to the larger family of believers.
  Acts 4:22-23 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.
  And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

  Hebrews 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
