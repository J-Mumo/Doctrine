https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iUbseiw3X4

Genesis 1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

Job 38:32-34 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?

1 Timothy 2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

Truth is in levels.
Truth is likened to light.
Truth can liberate but liberates in different levels.

Genesis 1:26-28 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

The image of God. (The nature of God): The nature of God can be learnt and understood.
  Isaiah 40:28-31 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
  But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

  Psalm 145:8-20 The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
  The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
  All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.
  They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
  To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
  Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
  The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
  The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
  Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
  The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
  The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
  He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
  The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.

  1 John 4:7-12 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
  He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
  In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
  Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
  No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

  Matthew 11:28-29 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
