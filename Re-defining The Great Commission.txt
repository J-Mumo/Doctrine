Matthew 9:36-38 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.

** The great commission **
Mark 16:15-20 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

Matthew 28:18-20 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

Acts 1:6-11 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

The great commission is a mandate given by Jesus to His disciples and now to all believers
  - to reach the entire globe with the gospel of salvation 
  - to bring nations to the knowledge of the truth through discipleship 
  - to consiquently bring territorial and societal transformation

Preach: Declare, proclaim, announce, bring to awareness and the content of preaching is the gospel.
The gospel of salvation is a revelation of the Father's love revealed in and through the subsitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ man and creation being the object of that sacrifice.

** 3 components in the great commission **
1. World evangelization
  Mark 16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
  - What to do: Go ye
  - What to preach: The gospel
  - Who to preach to: Every creature
  - Where to preach: The entire world
  - How to preach: The strategy is flexible. We must develop effective end time strategies for the task of world evangelization.

  Psalm 118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.

  What we desire (power, influence, prosperity, fame) should be in respect to the great commission.
  Acts 8:5-6 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
  And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

2. Discipleship
  Matthew 28:18-20 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

  Discipleship: The mentorship of believers to attain maturity and stature through doctrine.
                Helping believers understand the principals of the kingdom through the teaching ministry.

  The end product of discipleship is personal transformation and maturity.
  1 Corinthians 13:11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

  Ephesians 4:11-13 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
  For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
  Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

3. Territorial / Societal transformation
  The gospel was supposed to penetrate system and structures
  ** Areas of impact **
  1. The moral fabric of the society
  2. The quality of lives of the people within that territory, giving them a sense of empowerement, a sense of purpose and direction.
    John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
    Matthew 14:16-19 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
    And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
    He said, Bring them hither to me.
    And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

  ** Benefits the Lord brings to men **
  Psalm 103-5 Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

  3. Advancement in all spheres of society, Techonological, educational, health
    Genesis 41:37-57 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
    And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
    And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
    Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
    And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
    And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
    And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
    And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
    And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
    And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
    And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
    And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
    And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
    And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
    And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
    And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
    And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
    And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
    And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
    And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
    And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.
