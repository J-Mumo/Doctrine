## Foundational pillars of the gospel
1. The humanity of Christ.
  You must believe that Jesus walked in the flesh.
  God was made incanate, the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

  John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

2. The death of Christ.
  You must believe Jesus died.

3. The burial of Christ.
  You must believe that Jesus was buried.
  If Jesus wasn't buried then you can't believe in the resurrection.
  The resurrection is predicated upon the fact that He was buried.
  Jesus was not the first person to be brought back to life, but He was the fist person to resurrect.
  To be brought back to life means that you depend on the contribution of another.
  Resurrection does not depend on the contribution of another.

4. His resurrection.
  The anchor of the Christian faith is based on the resurrection.

5. His ascention and exaltation.
  John 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
  Philippians 2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

6. His imminent return.
  Acts 1:11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

## Implications of the resurrection.
1. It was a validation that Jesus was truly the Son of God.
  Romans 1:2-4 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
  Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
  And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

2. The resurrection gave credibility to all other words that Jesus spoke.
  He defended the most implicating statement He made, that He will die and resurrect.

3. The resurrection has become the central theme of the gospel of salvation.

4. The resurrection established the victory of Christ over sin, satan, death and the grave.

5. The resurrection today allows anyone who believes in Jesus to be a partaker of His life and His victory.

6. The resurection today gives every believer in Christ hope beyond death and hope beyond the grave.

1 Thessalonians 5:11 Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.

Colossians 1:12-14 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

John 10:10 The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance [to the full, till it overflows].

## Kinds of life we can experience
1. Biological / physical life. The life an individual can have at the point of conception / delivery.

2. Zoe: God's supernatural abundant life.
  It is spiritual in context however it is lived out in the physical realm.
  God's life came as an improvement and remedy to the limitations that came with the biological life.
    1 Corinthians 15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

  The presence of sin, the wickedness of men and demonic activities makes it impossible to live an excelling life from a purely biological standpoint.
    Genesis 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
    1 John 5:19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.
    John 5:12-14 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
    And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
    Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

Enjoying and maximizing the Zoe life demands that you walking in keeping with these factors:
1. Have an encounter with Jesus the Son of the living God.
  1 John 5:11-12 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
  He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.

  John 3:15-17 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

2. Knowledge of the promises and benefits that come with this life.
  Ephesians 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:

  Psalms 103:1-5 Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

3. Faith to appropriate the promises that come with that life. (Action & obedience)
  Hebrews 10:38-39 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
  But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.

4. Understand the warfare dimension of experiencing eternal life.
  Ephesians 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
