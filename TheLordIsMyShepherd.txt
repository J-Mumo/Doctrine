** The Lord Is My Shepherd **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjCCxf1U1E

Psalms 23 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Stagnation: A condition that is marked by lack of movement / progress
			A state of inactivity, having life but without motion
			
To fulfil your assignment and divine destiny you need to be guided and led by God
Confusion is part of the limitations in all men

Jeremiah 1:11-12 Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.

Luke 11:34-35 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.

Psalms 37:23-24 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.

Proverbs 16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.

Deuteronomy 32:10-13 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:
So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.
He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

** Keys to be led of and by God **
1. Admit that you are limited
	1 Corinthians 13:9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
	Psalm 25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
	
2. Pray earnestly for divine direction
	1 Samuel 30:8 And David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
	
	** Two ways you hear from God in prayer **
	a. Light from scripture
		Psalms 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
	b. The voice of His Spirit
		Isaiah 30:21 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
		
		John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
		
3. Open up you heart for supernatural encounters: Dreams and visions
	Genesis 41:1-6
	Exodus 3:2-5 And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
	And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
	And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
	
	1 Kings 3:4-5 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
	In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
	
	Matthew 2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
	
4. Counsel from authorities especially spiritual authorities
	Proverbs 1
	
5. The prophetic ministry
	1 Samuel 10:1-7 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
	When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
	Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
	And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:
	And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
	And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.
	
	2 Kings 8:1-13
