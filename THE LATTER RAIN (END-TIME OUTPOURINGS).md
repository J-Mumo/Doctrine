https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxc4cCs4AAk&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Joel 2:23-27 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.
And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.

Psalm 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.

Isaiah 32:15 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.

## A season of outpouring
1. It comes with a manifestation of mighty works in and through the saints.
2. A season of greater influence.
3. Greater witness
  Acts 4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
  John 1:6-7 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
  The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
  John 20:30-31 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
4. Increase and abundance
  Joel 2:25-26 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
  And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
5. Greater command of spiritual power

1. God will never force or impose His program on anyone.
2. The manifestation of God's desire and plan upon the earth depends on the availability, willingness and yieldedness of the saints.
  Isaiah 6:8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
  Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

## Kind of vessel God is looking for
1. A man who desires to know Him
  Daniel 11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.

  Jeremiah 9:23-24 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:
  But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.

  John 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

  Exodus 3:13-17 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
  And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.
  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
  Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:
  And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

  ### We know God by learning:
  1. His character
  2. His ways
  3. His power
    John 2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
    John 2:11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 

  ### Knowledge of God demands your:
  1. Time
  2. Consecration and devotion
  3. Study of the Word
  4. Fellowship with the Spirit in prayer and worship

2. A man who will truly and wholeheartedly love Him.
  Matthew 22:36-37 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

  Ephesians 3:17-19 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
  May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
  And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.

  ### Proofs that a man loves God
  1. He becomes your priority
    Exodus 2:3-4 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
    And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

    2 Chronicles 15:12-15 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
    That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
    And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
    And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.

  2. Obedience
    Deuteronomy 10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

    John 14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

  3. Love for the brethren
    1 John 4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

    Romans 12:10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
  
  4. Vessels who will serve Him. It means to be an active participant in birthing, manifesting His will, program, urposes.
    Romans 12:11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

    Deuteronomy 28:47-48 Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;
    Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
