** Exceeding Great And Precious Promises **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm9odJxyOsI

2 Peter 1:2-4 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

1 Corinthians 2:11-12 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

	* Know the conditions that are associated with the promises
	
2. The faith to engage the promises so that they deliver

	And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.
	Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

	No amount of sacrifice will substitute for the place of obedience
	
	1 Samuel 15:22-23 And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
