Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

2 Timothy 3:14-17 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.

Proverbs 1:1-5 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

Overcome: Confront, challenge and prevail over.
          Gain mastery of.

Overcomer: One who faces, challenges and subdues / gains control over an enemy, condition or a situation

## Lessons from an overcomer
1. Ignorance is not a demon.
  2 Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

  Proverbs 1:20-33 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:
  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

  1 Corinthians 8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

  The ultimate test for the presence of light is the absence of darkness.

  ### Action
  What areas are you ignorant in

2. You cannot have consistent results until you desires and expectations are defined.
  Luke 18:39-41 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
  And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
  Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

  Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

  ### Areas if you do not excel in you are not successful
  1. Spritual growth
  2. Mental transformation
  3. Purpose and ambition
  4. Health and wellness
  5. Financial well being
  6. Relationships
  7. Fulfilment and meaning: An ambassador of Christ

  ### Action
  What are your desires and expectations

3. People are not affected by what happens to them, but by the meaning they give to what happens to them

4. You need encouragement / motivation to start anything, but you need discipline and endurance to be consistent in life.
  Dimensions to discipline: 
    - The staying power
    - The power of restraint
  Hebrews 6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

  You must learn to say no to many good things if you desire greatness.

5. Do not be hasty with words / commitments. Think, pray and seek counsel before taking destiny defining decisions.
  Humans are largely interest motivated and self-centered.
  Patience is a virtue that forces deception to reveal itself

6. Critics and naysayers.
  Critics and naysayers do two important things needed to actualize destiny.
  1. Confirm you are making notable progress.
  2. Can be used to caution you from decline and destruction

7. 3 groups of people you must be aware of. It takes great wisdom and discretion to deal with them.
  1. Wicked people
    Proverbs 6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
    
    Proverbs 4:14-17 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
    Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
    For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
    For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.

  2. Selfish people: They are indifferent about your state provided they get what they are looking for.

  3. Ignorant / naive people: Show lack of consiousness, experience, maturity, wisdom, judgement

8. Define the most important things in your life. Not everything is worth dying for.
  The most important things in life are defined as what you can die for.
  1. Your relationship with Jesus
    Mark 8:35-37 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
    For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
    Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

  2. Your family (both biological and spiritual)
     
  4. Your assignment
    John 4:34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

  What is not worth dying for:
  Fame, money, competitive achievements, positions, titles

9. Learn from scars and from crowns
