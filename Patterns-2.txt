**Patterns**

God is a God of patterns
Success is proof that a divine pattern has been adhered to
Failure is proof that a divine pattern has been ignored, violated or not thoroughly followed
The Bible is a coded compendium of spiritual patterns that lead to various kinds and various levels of extraordinary results.

Exodus 25:9 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments
thereof, even so shall ye make it.

Exodus 25:40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.
Exodus 40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.
Exodus 40:33-34 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate.
	So Moses finished the work.
	Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

**Pattern for salvation**
Romans 10:8-10 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith,
	which we preach;
	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him
	from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

**Pattern for spiritual growth**

Ministry of the Word

**Pattern for building faith**
Faith cometh by hearing the Word of God
	- Hearing that produces awareness

**Pattern for accessing the annointing**
Psalm 89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him
It took a while to find his servant in David
The price is death
The annointing is not a gift but a reward

**Pattern for activating favour**
Proverbs 13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of the transgressor is hard
Transgression means a violation of patterns

**Pattern for building and maintaining relationships**
He that desires friends, must first show himself friendly

**Pattern for influence**

Joseph provided solutions
And Esther obtained favour from all that looked upon her
