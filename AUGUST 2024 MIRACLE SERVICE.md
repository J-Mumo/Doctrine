Miracles service begins when the Word of God goes forth.
  Luke 5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

  Psalm 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.

Most requests and desires are growth dependent.
  Galatians 4:1 Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;

Spirit manifestations, conditions and situations all depend on certain mindsets and certain belief sytems for them to work. Your belief system is your contribution to your success or failure.

## Character traits for a victorious life
1. Gratitude
  Psalm 92:1-2 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High:
  To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,

  1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 Rejoice evermore.
  Pray without ceasing.
  In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

2. Honor: The discerning, the celebrating and the rewarding of men for their contribution.

3. Diligence
  Proverbs 20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

4. Forgiveness.
  The value of forgiveness is when there is repentance, a change of heart.
  Colossians 3:13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

  Romans 16:17-18 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.
  For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.

5. Humility.
  James 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
  Proverbs 16:18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
