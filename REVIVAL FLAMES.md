Leviticus 6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.

Revival: A reawakening to true spirituality. A reawakening to righteousness from a state of spiritual domancy. A heightened state of God consiousness. 

Revival is 3-fold.
1. Personal revival.
  Ephesians 5:14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

2. Church revival.
  Ezekiel 37:10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

3. Territorial revival
  Jonah 3:2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.

## The tripartite feature of a revival
1. A restoration of God consiousness and true spirituality. Characterized by repentance, holiniss, righteousness, a renewed love for Jesus and spiritual things.

2. Multiplication of believers as a result of massive salvation.

3. Territorial transformation. A restoration of moral excellence, values, economical, technological

Genuine revivals are directly connected to the great commission.
