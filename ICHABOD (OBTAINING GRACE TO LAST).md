1 Samuel 4:1-22 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.
And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.

Every believer in Christ has a destiny of ever increasing glory
  Proverbs 4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
  Ezekiel 36:11 And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
  Ecclesiastes 7:8 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
  Job 8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.

## Why greatness is shortlived
1. Pride
  Proverbs 16:18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

  Proverbs 18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.

  Proverbs 29:23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.

  James 4:6-8 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

  Your passion to remain/last must exceed your passion to be known

2. An arrival mentality: The inability continue learning, iproving
  1 Corinthians 8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

  Yesterday's excellence will always be tomorrow's mediocrity.

  1 Timothy 4:15-16 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
  Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.

3. Distractions and compromises
  Galatians 5:7-9 Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
  This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

  Philippians 3:13-15 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
  I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

  Distraction: 
  - Getting into areas beyond the scope of your grace
    Ephesians 4:7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

  - Not protecting your focus / pursuit
    Acts 6:1-4 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
    Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
    Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
    But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.

4. Violating your winning strategy.
  Exploits and victory is always strategy dependent.
    2 Chronicles 15:12-15 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
    That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
    And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
    And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.

    Proverbs 3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
    
    Leviticus 9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.

5. Unaddressed weaknesses and vulnerabilities
  Any weakness unaddressed will eventually destroy you.
    Hebrews 12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

  1 weakness:
  - Offense: It comes with growth and increase.
    Acts 24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men.

    James 1:19-20 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
    For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

    Sometimes offense comes when your lust is not actualized.

6. Loss of passion and fire for God.
  2 Chronicles 26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper.

  Revelation 2:4-5 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
  Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

### 3 things one who desires to last must have
1. Prophetic intercessors who lift you up before God
  2 Thessalonians 3:1-2 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:
  And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.

  1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

2. A system of accountability for correction, advise, counsel, guidance and to speak over you prophetically

3. The gift of godly and faithful friends.
  Proverbs 18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
  Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
  For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
