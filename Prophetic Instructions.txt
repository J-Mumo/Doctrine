** Prophetic Instructions **

1. Give yourself continually to the Word and prayer
	Acts 6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
	1 Timothy 4:15-16 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
	
2. Invest in your health and well being. (Rest)
	Genesis 2:2-3 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
	And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
	
	Mark 4:37-38 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
	
	Psalm 127:1-2 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
	It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
	
3. Invest in building and maintaining your relationships
	Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.
	* Gratitude: Be thankful
	
4. Go on an end of year / personal retreat
	Isaiah 40:28-31 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
	He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
	Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:
	But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.
	
	Retreat: Time set apart to be with the Lord, to obtain renewal, direction and fresh empowerment.
	
	** What must be captured in a retreat **
	a. Thanksgiving
		Psalm 92:1-4 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High:
		To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
		Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
		For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
		
	b. An honest appraisal of the year / season past
		Proverbs 18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.
		
	c. Get direction for the next season
		Psalms 32:8  I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
		Proverbs 3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
		
	d. Planning and resolutions for the next year
		Luke 14:28-30 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
		Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,
		Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
		
	e. Obtain the doing grace
		John 13:17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
		
		Romans 7:19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
		
5. Share the love of Jesus to all around you.
	There are two principal ways to share the love of Jesus.
	- Preaching
	- Giving
	Romans 10:15  And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
	Daniel 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.
