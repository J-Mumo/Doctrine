** The Manifest Presence of God **

Zephaniah 3:17 The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.

Psalm 23:1-6 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
	He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Mark 4:35-41 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
	And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?
	And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
	
**Dimensions of the presence of God**
1. His omnipresence.
	Psalm 139:7-12  Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
		If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
		If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
		Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
		If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
		Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
		
2. His Emmanuel dimension
	Matthew 18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
	
3. His manifest presence. His Shekinah
	Exodus 40:34-38 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
		And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
		And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
		But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
		For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
		

The Presence of God: The influence of His person through His Spirit in and upon our lives.

	Genesis 39:2 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
	Genesis 39:21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
	
2. Rest round about
	Exodus 33:13-14 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
	And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
 	
	2 Chronicles 15:12-15 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
	That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
	And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.
	
3. Supernatural protection and preservation
	Psalm 23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
	
	Isaiah 43:1-3 But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.
	When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
	For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
	
	Daniel 3:23-29 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
	He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
	And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
	Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
	Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

		“For I am the Lord your God,
		The Holy One of Israel, your Savior;
		I have given Egypt [to the Babylonians] as your ransom,

		“Because you are precious in My sight,
		You are honored and I love you,
		I will give other men in return for you and other peoples in exchange for your life. 
		“Do not fear, for I am with you;
		I will bring your offspring from the east [where they are scattered],
		And gather you from the west.
		“I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’
		And to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’
		Bring My sons from far way
		And My daughters from the ends of the earth,
		
	Job 42:10-11 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.
	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
	
	1 Samuel 18:10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
	And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
	And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and was departed from Saul.
	Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
	And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the Lord was with him.
	Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
	But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.

	Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.

	And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
	Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
