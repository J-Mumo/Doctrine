John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
Ephesians 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:

## The dynamics of liberty
1. Salvation: Encounter with Jesus.
  The new birth experience is not the totality og the believers experience, it is the starting point of a journey that should lead to liberty.
    John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
    1 John 5:11-12 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
    He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.
    Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
    For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

  Being saved by confessing the Lordship of Jesus does not automatically bring you into the experience of victory.
  Being saved gives you access, not experience.
    John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
    John 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

  God's intent for men does not end in getting saved but living a life of victory.
    1 Timothy 2:1-4 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
    For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
    For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
    Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

2. Knowing the truth.
  It describes the whole process of accessing light to being transformed by it.
  1. Access to truth.
    John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

    ### Steps to know the truth
    1. Access to the Word
    2. Access to the Holy Spirit
    3. Access to the ministry of the teaching priest

  2. Hearing and receiving the truth.
  
  3. You must submit to transformation with reference to that truth.
    
## How transformation leads to victory
Our realities in this kingdom are shaped by our belief systems, our mindsets and the quality of our thinking.
The information that is stored in our minds are in layers and they exert different levels of power over our lives and over our outcomes.
Transformation leads to liberty by empowering the saints to make superior destiny advancing choices and decisions.

## How transformation by light leads to liberty
Thoughts, mindsets and belief system have an energy that they emit from within you to the environment. They exhibit magnetic properties. They attract to your life.
  Job 3:25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.

Victory depends on a belief system.
Defeat depends on a belief system.
Being victimized by curses and yokes is mentally dependent.
Increase and prosperity depends on a belief system.
Manifesting excellence and leadership depends on a belief system.
Walking in the anointing depends on a belief system.
You can be saved and still be a victim of limitations and frustrations.

Pastors and ministers must realise the sesitivity of the roles they play in the destinies of people.

Knowing the truth by the ministry of light will make you see and reveal the real value of light.

The ultimate proof of the presence and the power of light is not intelligence but liberty.
