**LET THEM HAVE DOMINION**

**Foundation**
1. God is the creator, owner and ruler of everything
	Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
	
	Psalm 121:1-2  I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
	My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.
	
	1 Chronicles 29:11 Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.
	
	Revelation 4:10-11 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
	Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
	
2. God is the exclusive owner of all power
	2 Chronicles 20:6 And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
	
	Psalm 62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
	
Genesis 1:26-28 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.


Dominion: The right to govern / sovereign control / authority
Power: Capacity to influence or change / The force compels that compliance
Authority: The right to represent / The legitimate ground to allow power to function

Authority makes administering power legal / legitimate
God gave man authority without conditions, but with power there are conditions
Psalm 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
Luke 10:19 Listen carefully: I have given you authority [that you now possess] to tread on [a]serpents and scorpions, and [the ability to exercise authority] over all the power of the enemy (Satan); and nothing will [in any way] harm you.

**Qualities of a man**
1. Is a spirit
2. Place of residence of the spirit must be domiciled in a material body
3. The spirit in the body must have the mind (interface between spirit and body: (contains emotions, intellect, will...)

**Let them have dominion means**
1. Man is the legal steward and ruler in the earth
	Psalm 8:2-8 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
	All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
	
	Hebrews 2:5-8 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?
	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
	
2. Nothing legal can and should happen in the earth without man's co-operation and participation

3. Man became the most valuable asset in the earth needed by both God and satan.
	Isaiah 6:8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
	
	Ezekiel 22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
	
	Luke 22:3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
	
4. All of creation can and should praise the Lord but only man can allow His purposes and His will through patnership to be done in earth
	Psalm 150:6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.
	Psalm 69:34  Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
	
	**God comes down by sending men**
	Exodus 3:4-10 And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
	And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
	And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
	Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
