** Deliver Us From Evil **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNiK02sKwqg

Matthew 6:5-13 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

Acts 16:11-24 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.
And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.
And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,
And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

The nature of the fallen man and the believer who is not transformed will always react negatively to lifting / rising.

1 Corinthians 16:9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.

Deliver: Save / salvage / rescue / set free

** 3 levels of evil **
1. Satan & wicked spirits
	1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
	
2. Wicked and unreasonable men
	2 Thessalonians 3:1-3 Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:
	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.
	
	Genesis 37:3-11 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
	For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
	And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
	Genesis 37:18-20 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
	
3. The flesh
	Romans 7:18-24 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
	
	Flesh: The vulnerabilities and the negative tendencies that come with the fallen nature.
	
Deliverence in the kingdom and the in the spirit is only for men who understand the power of humility and the power of submission.(Brokenness)
1 Peter 5:6-7 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

James 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

2 Corinthians 3:5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

Deliverence from God is based on a response system
1. A response to a cry for mercy
	Lamentations 3:22 It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
	
	Luke 18:35-43 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
	And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
	And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
	And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.
	And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.
	And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
	Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
	And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
	And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

	Hebrews 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
	
2. A response to heartfelt prayer
	Matthew 26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
	
	1 Peter 5:8-9 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
	
	Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
	
	Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
	
3. A response to praise
	Psalm 18:1-3 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.
	The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
	I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
	
	Exodus 15:1-11 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
	The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
	The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.
	Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
	The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
	Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
	Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
	
	Acts 16:25-34 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
	And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
	And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
	Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
	And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
	And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
	And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
	And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
	
Job 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?

Psalm 82:5-7 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
