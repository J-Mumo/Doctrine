  ### Levels of knowledge to walk in dominion

    - Study of His character, ways, power.
    John 17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

  2. Understand the laws of the kingdom
    - The law of seed time and harvest
    - The law of faith
    - The law of relationships
    - The dynamics of prayer
    - The law of honour
    - The dynamics of warfare
    - The law of diligence
    - The prophetic
      Ezra 6:14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.

  3. Knowledge in your field of endevour.

1. Every believer in Christ has a preordination upon their life to be a sign and a wonder, to be a proof producer
  Isaiah 8:18 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.

  1 Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;

2. God desires for His glory to be revealed in and through the saints

3. One of the major pillars of dominion, fruitfulness in the kingdom is wisdom

1 Corinthians 2:1-7 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

Hidden: Sealed / cutomized / not for public / classified
Ordain: Legitimize an operation
The hidden wisdom unlocks the glory of God in your life.
Whoever acceses that wisdom, the law mandates that every obstacle must give way.
The purpose of this wisdom is to heko the saints manifest the glory of God
  Ephesians 3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

  Why did God give us this wisdom.
    Jeremiah 10:23 O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

2 Kings 5:7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

### How to access this wisdom
1. Accessing this level of wisdom depends on your relationship with the Holy Spirit
  John 16:12-15 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
  He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
  All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

  1 Corinthians 2:8-12 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
  But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
  But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
  For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
  Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

2. This wisdom is released on demand basis. It answers to a request.
  Jeremiah 33:3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.

  Philippians 4:6 e careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

  James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

  Ephesians 5:15-17 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

3. This is wisdom is released by engaging the tripatite combination of heartfelt prayer, deep worship and meditation.
  Ephesians 3:1-5 For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
  If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
  How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
  Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
  Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
  Ephesians 3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

The hidden wisdom of God provides prepared answers to any issues of life and delivers to the saints a way out of every situation.
  1 Corinthians 10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
