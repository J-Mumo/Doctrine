** They glorified God in Me **

Galatians 1:24 And they glorified God in me
Matthew 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

Glorify: Make famous
		 Announce the worth / value of  thing / a person
		 Compel the attention of men towards a person / thing
		 
John 15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

John 17:1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:

** The expressions of the glory of God through the life of a man **
Jeremiah 9:23 Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:

1. Wisdom
	Revelation 5:12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
	Ephesians 1:17 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
	Isaiah 11:2 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
	James 3:15-17 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
	For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
	1 Corinthians 2:6-7 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
	Mark 6:2-3 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?
	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
	
	Wisdom is the supernatural ability to use the written and the inspired Word of God to make accurate decisions and provide solutions to life's problems.
	
	** How to access the widom of God **
	1. Through the Word of God
		2 Timothy 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
	2. Ask in prayer
		James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
	3. Impartation from carriers of this wisdom with proofs
		Numbers 27:18-20 And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
		And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
		And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
		
		Deuteronomy 34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.

2. Power: The supernatural force that is responsible for enforcing the will of God
	Romans 1:3-4 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
	And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
	
	Hebrews 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:
	
	Psalms 24:8 Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
	
	Jeremiah 32:17 Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:
	
	The principal way the power of God is released from the saints over situations is through words.
	Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
	Psalms 66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
