https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPzKxogVpk4&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Luke 1:1-4 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,
Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;
It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.

## The infalibility of the word of God
Infalible: Accurate, potent.
The bible: Is an inspired resource that contains the revelation of God to man accurately scripted.
Scripture: Writings

The infalibility of scripture is not in it's historical, intellectual,archeological accuracy, but in it's ability to accurately reveal God, Jesus Christ, man's sinful condition, God's salvation plan for man.

The bible has 3 layers:
1. Historic layer
2. Doctrinal layer
3. Prophetic layer

Bible: A compendium of 66 seperate yet related books written by over 40 authors over a period of 1,600 years from men and women who cut across various walks of life. Broadly seprate into Old Testament 39 books and the New Testament 27 books.

Scipture: Writings that came by the inspiration of God. (Holy scriptures, oracles of God)
  2 Timothy 3:15-16 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

  Hebrews 5:12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

The word of God:
  1. Jesus, the living Word.
    John 1:1-2 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
    The same was in the beginning with God.

  2. The written word. A compendium of God's thoughts in written form.

The living Word is revealed in the written word.
The written Word points us to the living Word.
  John 5:39-40 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
  And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

  Luke 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

### Factors that prove the reliability of the bible
1. 40 different men writting 66 books by 40 different authors in 3 different languages over a period of 1,600 years showing the progressive revelation of God, Jesus Christ and the salvation work of God

2. The fulfilment of prophecies
  Matthew 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

  Matthew 2:17-18 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
  In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

  Matthew 4:14-16 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
  The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
  The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.

  Acts 3:18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

## The Doctrine of God
The bible never tries to prove the existence of God. It declares the existence of God.
  Genesis 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

  Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

The bible describes God as the eternal self existent one.

Creation is the most visible evidence of the existence of God.
  Romans 1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

There are 6 attributes that define God and sets Him in a class by Himself:
1. God is eternal. He does not have a beginning or an end. He has always been and will always be.
  Exodus 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

  Genesis 21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.

  1 Timothy 1:17 Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

  Revelation 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

2. God is self existent. He does not depend on anything to maintain or sustain Him.
  Psalm 36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.

  John 5:26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;

3. God is immutable. He is unchanging in His person or character.
  James 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.

  Psalm 33:11 The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.

  Malachi 3:6 For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

4. God is omnipotent. He is all powerful.
  Revelation 19:6 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

  Revelation 4:11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

  Hebrews 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

5. God is omniscient. He is all knowing. (Perfect knowledge, perfect understanding, perfect wisdom)
  Proverbs 15:3 The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.

  Psalm 147:5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.

  Hebrews 4:12-13 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

6. God is omnipresent. He is always present, not affected by time and space.
  Psalm 139:7-12 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
  If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
  If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
  Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
  If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
  Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
