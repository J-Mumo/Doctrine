** Keys to Destiny Fulfillment **

Destiny: A pre-determined future
		- God's pre-determined plan, purpose and place in His program
		Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
		Ephesians 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
		Hebrews 10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
		
** Facts about destiny **
1. Every man was born for a reason. Your purpose for existence represents the solution you were sent to bring to humanity.
	Romans 8:30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
	John 18:37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

2. Your destiny has been pre-determined by God. It takes your choices and decisions to actualize it or miss out on it
	Deuteronomy 30:15-19 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
		In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
		But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
		I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
		I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
		
3. Destiny can be aborted
	Acts 1:15-20 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
	Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.
	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.
	Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
	And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.
	25: That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.

	Endurance: The ability to stand and survive pain and pressure while maintaining focus.
	James 1:2-4 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
	Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
	But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
	
** The Law of Process **
Mark 4:26-32 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;
	And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
	And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?
	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
	But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
