1 Chronicles 29:11 Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.

Psalm 66:5-7 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

Ephesians 1:18-19 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

Power: The capacity to influence outcomes.
       The force that compels compliance.
        Psalm 66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

### Implication of the days of His power
1. Days of His power refer to the days of staying in His presence until the weight of His glory and power rest upon us.
  Luke 24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

2. The days of the manifestation of the sons of God.
  Romans 1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

  Romans 8:19-21 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
  For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,
  Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

  Ephesians 3:10 To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

3. The days of mighty works through the wisdom of God.
  Mark 6:1-2 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.
  And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

4. Days of supernatural outpourings, access to higher levels of grace.

5. Days of liberty from all operations of the devil.
  Isaiah 61:1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;

  Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

6. Days of miracles signs and wonders of all sorts.
  The full gospel is the gospel and the power that backs that message.
    Romans 15:19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

7. Days of massive soul winning an in gathering.
  Acts 2:5-7 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
  Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
  And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
  Acts 2:37-47 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
  Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
  And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
  And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
  And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
  And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
  Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

8. The days where we have access to supernatural resources.
  1 Chronicles 29:1-9 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.
  Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
  Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.
  Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:
  The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord?
  Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
  And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
  And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
  Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

  Psalm 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.

2. Contend for higher levels of light, knowledge, spiritual understanding.

3. Expand your spiritual capacity through a consistent prayer life.
  Capacity to percieve, receive, retain.

4. Hold fast your profesion of faith.
  Hebrews 10:23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)

  Keep your mind and your heart focused on what God is doing and not your current reality.
  2 Corinthians 4:18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.

5. Be determined to take obedient actions.
  Hebrews 10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.

  James 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
