Jeremiah 51:20-24 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;
And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;
With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;
I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.
And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord.

God's prophetic programs is divided into:
    1. General prophetic program
        1 Timothy 2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
    2. Unique prohetic programs that are seasonal, dispensational and highly specific
        1 Chronicles 12:32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.

Your relevance in this kingdom is predicated on:
    1. The degree to which you yield yourslef to birth the glory of God.
    2. The degree to which you partner with the Spirit to align to partner with God's prophetic program and bring fruition.

What does it look like when God moves on a people:
    1. Extraordinary manifestations of His power
    2. A greater level of kingdom influence
    3. Massive salvation of souls
    4. Increase and abundance in all its ramifications
    5. Higher dimensions of sensitivity in the spirit

God will never force or impose His program on anyone.
The manifestation of God's desire and God's prophetic program will depend on the availability, willingness and yieldedness of the saints
    Luke 1:38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

## Kind of vessel God is looking for:
1. Men and women who truly desire to know Him
    Daniel 11:32 ...but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.

    Jeremiah 9:24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.

2. People with sufficient spiritual intelligence to birth and execute His prophetic program.
    Job 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?

    ### How to tear down altars
    Jeremiah 1:10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.

    2 Samuel 24:25 And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

    Altar: Place, platform, system where the spirit realm makes contact with the physical realm on legal grounds.
    A platform for the authorization of laws and spirits to function on earth.
    Altars legitimize the operation of spirits on earth.
    A platform where covenants are activated and maintained
    Altars can be physical monuments, institutions, men, non-material platforms like words.

    Major assignment of an altar is to provide human partnership, authorization, continuity and discontinuity to any spiritual activity on earth whether godly or demonic.

    An altar is a partnership platform, a spiritual negotiation table where the matters that deal with the destinies of men are agreed upon.

    #### Kinds of altars
    1. Evil / demonic altars: They allow operation of darkness within a life, family, community or nation on legal basis.
    2. Righteous / godly altars: They allow operation of the Holy Spirit, angels and the Word of God to work profitably for an individual.

    Judges 6:25-26 And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:
    And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.

    ### How to detect the presence of an altar
    Consistency of patterns and occurences.
    Any consistent operation on the earth shows that it is being powered by an altar.

    #### Examples of occurences
    1. Infirmities and mysterious diseases.
    2. Sexual perversions of all sorts.
    3. Witchcraft and idol worship.
    4. Untimely death.
    5. Stagnation and delays.
