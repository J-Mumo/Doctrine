https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jafIW8Sq3vA&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Luke 19:9-10 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

Matthew 4:18-19 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.

1. - Jesus told them in advance what they will become.
  - He only changed the mission but they still remained fishers.
  - The only thing the fishers did not have was the knowledge of their calling

2. Come, follow me
  When God calls you, you start afresh.
  You need a season of following.
  The first requirement in becoming a fisher of men, is your training, not the fishing itself.

There are fishing principles that can help a believer become an effective soul winner.
### The training of a fisherman (soul winner)
1. You need to understand the sea, that is where you find fish.
  The sea for the believer represents the entire globe.

2. You need to know the various kinds of fish there are at sea.

3. There are various techniques for catching fish.
  Not everybody will be saved on a crusade ground or by a preacher, but everybody should be saved.
  Every God ordained ministry in the body of Christ is sent to a particular group of men.
  There are diversities of ministries across the body.

4. You must have a functional boat to gather the fish you have caught.
  Luke 5:4-6 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.
  And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.
  And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.

  Do you have systems in place to follow up the sinners that were saved.
  Otherwise both the souls and you might peris.
  YOur harvest will always be wasted when the boat is too small or you have no boat.

5. You cannot effectively fish in isolation. Respect and engage with other fishermen.
  Luke 5:6-7 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.
  And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

  Matthew 9:37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;

  Matthew 4:21-22 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, MENDING THEIR NETS; and he called them.
  And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.

6. Fishing reqiores great patience, persistence and discipline.
  Soul winning requires great patience, persistence and discipline wrapped up with genuine compassion.
  
  Ephesians 2:1-6 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
  Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
  But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
  Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
  And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

7. You must be mindful of your safety as a fisherman while you fish.
  ### Safety nets you must put
  1. The intercessory prayer ministry. Have a strong backing of intercessors.

  2. Practise periodic retreats.
    Isaiah 40:31 But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

  3. Learn from skilled fishermen with proof

8. Your love for Jesus alongside your desire to please Him must be greater than your desire for ministry, fame, power, money, evangelism, etc.
