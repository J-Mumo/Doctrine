1 Chronicles 12:32 And of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do, 200 chiefs; and all their kinsmen were under their command;

God is a God of times and seasons

1. They understood the times
2. They knew what Israel ought to do at a time
3. Men were at their command

Genesis 1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:


1. Discernment through understanding
	Discernment is the faculty of spiritual perception. The ability to know what God is doing, what the devil is doing or what is happening within the cosmos. It is a superior faculty that the believer in partnership with the Holy Spirit can sustain.
	
2. Dominion is strategy dependent
	For every prophetic season you must obtain a strategy.
	
	
** Prophetic instructions **
1. James 1:19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

2. Obtain light throught the ministry of the Word.

	Psalm 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
	
3. Watch and pray
	Matthew 26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
	
	Ezekiel 22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
	
4. Reject a victim mentality
	John 3:31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
