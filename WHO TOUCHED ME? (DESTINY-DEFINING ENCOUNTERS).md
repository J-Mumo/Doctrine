https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIMX-gyJqRc&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Luke 8:41-48 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.

1. Men can touch God in a way that radically changes the course of their destinies for good.

Touch: Come in contact with.
       To connect to.
       To produce feelings of affection and empathy.

Using the third definition:
To touch Jesus means something a man can do that can produce within him the feelings of affection, sympathy and empathy.

The multitudes had access and proximity, they even had contact with Him without any evident transformation.
  Luke 8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

There are clear unmistakable evidences when men touch God:
1. Reverence and honor for God. This comes by the revelation of the true state of your heart leading to reverance and homor; according to Isaiah 6.
  Luke 8:47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
  Psalm 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

2. Superior proof producing wisdom.
  Proverbs 9:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.

3. Liberty.
  Luke 8:43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
  Luke 8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
  
  Matthew 11:28-30 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

  2 Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

4. Genuine power. You receive an unction that transforms your life and then from you transforms the nations.
  Luke 8:46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.

5. Peace.
  Luke 8:48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
  
  John 14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

  Philippians 4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

## What kind and what manner of man is able to touch God.
1. A man with a broken and a contrite heart.
  A broken heart: A heart that is ever aware of your insufficiency outside of the help and the mercy of God.
  2 Corinthians 3:4-6 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
  Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
  Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

  Psalm 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

  Psalm 100:3 Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

2. A man who perpetually acknowledges and honors God.
  1 Samuel 2:30 Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

  Proverbs 3:5-6 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

3. A man who chooses to walk and live by faith.
  Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

  Genesis 15:6 And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

4. A man with a heart of genuine gratitude.
  Psalm 69:30-32 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
  This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
  The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.

5. One who is willing to not just receive but to be a blessing.
  Luke 8:46-47 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
  And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

  Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

  2 Corinthians 1:4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

Who touched me, can also be that men can touch God in a way that leads to their destruction.

# The kind of man that can touch God in a way that leads to their destruction.
1. One who perpetually fights the advancement of God's kingdom.
  Exodus 5:1-3 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
  And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.
  And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

  Matthew 21:12-15 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
  And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
  And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
  And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
