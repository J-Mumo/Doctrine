Supernatural answers and solutions do not just appear. They are spiritual reactions. They are effects of engaging specific spiritual keys.

## 5 factors that translate to the miraculous
1. Heartfelt prayers.

  Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

2. The Word
  Luke 5:15-17 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
  And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.
  And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

  Habakkuk 3:3-4 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.

  Luke 6:17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;

3. Heartfelt worship
  2 Chronicles 5:13-14 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord;
  So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.

  Acts 16:25- And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.
  And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.

4. The prophetic / the sent word
  Psalm 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.

  John 2:7-8 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

5. The anointing

  Isaiah 61:1-3 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
  To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
  To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.

  Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
