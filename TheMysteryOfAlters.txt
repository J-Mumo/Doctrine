**THE MYSTERY OF ALTARS**

Genesis 35:1-7 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
	And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
	And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
	And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
	And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
	
Genesis 8:20-22 And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
	And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
	
Genesis 12:7-8 And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
	And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.

Genesis 13:3-4 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
	Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.

Genesis 13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.

Genesis 22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

Genesis 26:25  And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.

Genesis 33:19-20 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.
	And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.
	
Exodus 17:14-15 And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:
	

altar: A place / platform / system where the spirit realm makes contact with the physical realm on legal grounds.
	Luke 1:10-11 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
		And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

All satanic altars are powered by one major altar: The altar of sin and iniquity
Judges 6:1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
				
Hosea 7:1 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.

Romans 5:12-14 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
	(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
	
John 9:1-2 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
	And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
	
	
**Levels of sin**
1. Personal sin
	1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

2. Territorial sin
	Genesis 18:20-23 And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.
	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?

	Jonah 1:1-2 Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
	Jonah 3:3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.

3. Sin based on foundations and bloodline
	Psalms 11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
	
	Exodus 34:6-14 And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
	Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
	But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
	For thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
	
	
All Godly altars are powered by one major altar: The throne of Grace alongside the blood of Jesus that is called the eternal covenant.

Hebrews 4:14-16 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
	
Hebrews 12:22-24 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.
	
Hebrews 13:20-21 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
	
	
** How to raise and maintain altars **
Today, we do not raise altars by erecting physical structures and monuments necessarily.

1 Kings 18:19-39 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
	So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
	And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
	Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
	Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
	And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
	And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
	And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
	And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
	And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
	And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And HE REPAIRED THE ALTAR OF THE LORD THAT WAS BROKEN DOWN.
	And Elijah TOOK TWELVE STONES, ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE TRIBES OF THE SONS OF JACOB, UNTO WHOM THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME, SAYING, ISRAEL SHALL BE THY NAME:
	And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
	And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
	And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
	And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND OF ISRAEL, LET IT BE KNOWN THIS DAY THAT THOU ART GOD IN ISRAEL, AND THAT I AM THY SERVANT, AND THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AT THY WORD.
	Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
	Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
	And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.
	
1. Repentance and brokenness
	2 Samuel 24:1 And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
	2 Samuel 24:10-15 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
	For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
	Go and say unto David, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
	So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
	And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
	So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
	
2. The Word of God: The promises of God

3. Sacrifice
	There are 3 levels of sacrifice
	1. Yourself:
		Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
	2. Praise and worship
		Hebrews 13:15 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
	3. Your prayers
		Leviticus 6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
	4. Seed (giving)
	5. Prophetic decrees and blessings
	
Put the sacrifice in order bfirst before calling on God
1 Kings 18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
	
Samuel 24:16-25 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
	And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
	And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
	And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the Lord commanded.
	And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
	And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
	And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
	All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.
	And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
	And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
