6. Sacrifice
  1 Samuel 1:21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
  Psalm 50:5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
  John 15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

  ### Why God demands sacrifice
  1. One of the ways we conquor idolatry and materialism
  1. Your sacrifice unto God is an expression is an expression of love and value for Him above all things.
    Isaiah 29:13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:
  2. Your sacrifice is an expression of honor.
    1 Samuel 2:30 Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
  3. It is one of the mystries that control divine intervention
    1 Kings 18:30-33,38 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.
    And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
    And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
    And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
    Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.

  4. It is one of the mystries for accessing the sworn blessing.
    Genesis 22:15-18 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
    And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
    That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
    And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.

    Numbers 23:19-20 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
    Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
