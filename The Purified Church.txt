** The Purified Church **

1. Jesus is coming back, and is coming back soon
	Revelation 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
	Revelation 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
	Revelation 22:20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
	Acts 1:10-11 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
	Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
	
2. He is coming for a kind of church
	Ephesians 5:26-27 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
	
3. It is the assignment of the 5 fold to help build and mature the body to be effecienct
	Ephesians 4:11-16 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
	That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:
	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
	
The Lord purifies His church by commendation and correction
Philippians 1:3-6  I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:

Hebrews 12:5-11 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

Revelation 2:1-11 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.


** 7 Deadly sins that must be purged **
1. Sexual immorality and related perversions
	1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 For this is the will of God, that you be sanctified [separated and set apart from sin]: that you abstain and back away from sexual immorality; 4 that each of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor [being available for God’s purpose and separated from things profane], 5 not [to be used] in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God and are ignorant of His will;
	
	Acts 15:28-29 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any greater burden than these essentials: 29 that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from [consuming] blood, and from [eating the meat of] things that have been strangled, and from sexual impurity. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.”

	- The desire for intimacy is not demonic
	- The spirit of lust and immorality capitalizes on this blessing that God has put in men and pervets it for their destruction
	
	** Steps to be free **
	1. Admit it 
		Psalms 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
	2. Set aside time for retreat as soon as possible. A retreat gives the platform to pray, study scripture, fast  and be broken before God your maker
		Psalm 51 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
		Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
		For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
		Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
		Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
		Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
		Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
		Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
		Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
		Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
		Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
		Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
		Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
		Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
		O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
		For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
		The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
		Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
		Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
	3. Where it persists, seek help
	4. Create rules and boundaries in and around your life
		Proverbs 25:28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
	5. Connect to a larger family of believers. Community kingdom living is the key to sustaining kingdom values
		Hebrews 10:25  not forsaking our meeting together [as believers for worship and instruction], as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more [faithfully] as you see the day [of Christ’s return] approaching.
		
2. Lust for money and material things
	Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
	
	I Timothy 6:6-10 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
	
	- Be properly mentored on the kingdom's pathway to wealth and abundance
		* First law is absolute surrender 
		
3. Witchcraft and extra-biblical practises
	Deuteronomy 18:9-14 When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
	There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.
	Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
	For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
	Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.
	For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.
	
	Ezekiel 13:1-11 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the Lord;
	Thus saith the Lord God; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
	O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.
	They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The Lord saith: and the Lord hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.
	Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The Lord saith it; albeit I have not spoken?
	Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord God.
	And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord God.
	Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:
	Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
	
	Acts 16:16-18 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:
	The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.
	And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
	
	** Solution **
	2 Corinthians 4:1-2 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
	
	Hebrews 12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
	
	- Fear God
	
4. Pride, vain glory and self-centeredness
	James 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, GOD RESISTETH THE PROUD, but giveth grace unto the humble.
	
	Luke 18:9-14 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
	Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
	I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
	And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
	
	Romans 12:1-6 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
	So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
	
	** Cure **
	John 3:22-30 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
	For John was not yet cast into prison.
	Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
	And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
	John answered and said, A MAN CAN RECEIVE NOTHING, EXCEPT IT BE GIVEN HIM FROM HEAVEN.
	Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
	HE MUST INCREASE, BUT I MUST DECREASE.
	
5. The sin of the tongue
	Psalms 34:12-13 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
	Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
	
	Proverbs 6:16-19 These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
	An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
	A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
	
	** Cure **
	Psalms 141:3-4 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
	Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
	
	Ephesians 4:29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
	
6. Competition and unhealthy comparison of men/structures
	2 Corinthians 10:12-18 We do not have the audacity to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with some who [supply testimonials to] commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they lack wisdom and behave like fools. 13 We, on the other hand, will not boast beyond our proper limit, but [will keep] within the [a]limits of our commission (territory, authority) which God has granted to us as a measure, which reaches and includes even you. 14 We are not overstepping the limits of our province, as if we did not [legitimately] reach to you, for we were the [very] first to come even as far as you with the good news of Christ. 15 We do not go beyond our proper limit, boasting in the work of other men, but we have the hope that as your faith [in Christ and His divine power] continues to grow, our field among you may be greatly expanded [but still within the limits of our commission], 16 so that we may preach the gospel even in the lands beyond you, but not to boast in work already accomplished in another one’s field of activity. 17 However, “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.” 18 For it is not he who commends and praises himself who is approved [by God], but it is the one whom the Lord commends and praises.
	
7. The sin of imbalance: Failure to embrace and communicate the whole counsel of God
	Acts 20:27-28 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
	Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
	
	Acts 18:24-26 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
	
	Revelation 21:9-11 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
	Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
	Revelation 21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
	
	
1 John 2:1-2 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

Isaiah 55:6-7 Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

1 Corinthians 10:11-12 Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

2 Corinthians 1:3-4 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
