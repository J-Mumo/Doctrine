**Deliverance**

Ways demons and satan have access to all men
1. Covenants: A covenant is a system of authorization between two or more people ratified by the mystrey of blood
	with mutual advantages if kept and severe consequences if violated.
2. Disobedience:
	Deutoronomy 28
3. Ignorance
	Ephesians 4:18 Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance 
	that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
	Psalm 82:5-8 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the 
	earth are out of course.
	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
	
*Levels of satanic influences*
1. Deception: 
	2 Peter 2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
	2 Peter 2:12-13 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they 
		understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
		And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they 
		are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
	Revelation 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the 
		whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
		
	Strives on strength of senses
		
2. Manipulation and control: Strives in the realm of the mind
	Luke 22:31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
	
3. Complete possession of spirit, soul and body
	Mark 5:9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
	
Strength of satan over lives: the flesh

**The flesh**
Romans 7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; 
	but how to perform that which is good I find not.
	
The flesh is a nature of living, thinking and acting that is against the ways of God
Salvation: Deliverance to remedy the flesh

The flesh is also a stronghold in our minds that is fortified by the presence of demon spirits that is motivated by
self-centeredness, vain glory and self exhaltation

**Remedy for the flesh**
Galatians 5:16-17 This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: 
	so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
	
Colossians 3:1-2 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right 
	hand of God.
	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
	
**Demons**
Matthew 13:24-30
Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, 
	and thou shalt bruise his heel.
Genesis 6

**Levels of deliverance**
1. Casting out of spirit influences in your life and at the back of your challenges
2. Deliverance through transformation by the Word of God
	Mark 5:12-15 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
		And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: 
		and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) 
		and were choked in the sea.
		And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what 
		it was that was done.
		And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, 
		and IN HIS RIGHT MIND: and they were afraid.
		
3. Discipline of conformity: You actively participate
	Romans 8:13  For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, 
		ye shall live.
	Galatians 6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall 
		of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
	Philippians 3:12-15 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may 
		apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
		Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, 
		and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
		I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
		Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, 
		God shall reveal even this unto you.
		
**Experiencing complete deliverance**

John 19:28-30 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, 
	saith, I thirst.
	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put 
	it to his mouth.
	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
	
Proverbs 26:2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.

Isaiah 41:20-21 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, 
	and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.
	Produce your cause, saith the Lord; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob.
	
1. Break the legal hold of satan
	Mystrey of The Blood
	Plead the blood
	Matthew 26:27-28 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
		For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
	Ephesians 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
	Colossians 1:14  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
	Revelation 5:9-10 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: 
		for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
		And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
	Revelation 12:10-11 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of
		our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God
		day and night.
		And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives 
		unto the death.
	Psalm 51
	
2. The power of words
	Matthew 12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
	Psalm 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
	Let those who have become benefactors of His blood make that announcement in the realm of the spirit,
	decree and declare that you are free
	Speak and denounce yourself from every work of darkness
	
3. The ministry of the annointing
	Luke 4:17-21 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, 
		he found the place where it was written,
		The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me 
		to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set 
		at liberty them that are bruised,
		To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
		And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in 
		the synagogue were fastened on him.
		And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.
	Isaiah 10:27 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, 
		and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
