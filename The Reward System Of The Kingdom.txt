** The Reward System Of The Kingdom **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI01W9ZzwH4

One of the names God has and God is, is The Rewarder.

Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

Revelation 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.

Reward: To give something to someone in recognition of service, effort, contribution or achievement

1 Samuel 17:24-27 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.
And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

Matthew 19:27-30 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

2 Timothy 4:7-8 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

The Lord rewards men because we walk by motivation.

** There are 3 main things that God rewards **
1. Diligent pursuit: Any kind and any dimension of diligent pursuit is rewarded
	Jeremiah 29:13: And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
	
2. Faithfulness
	Matthew 25:14-30 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
	And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
	His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
	Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
	And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
	His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
	Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
	For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
	
	Galatians 6:9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
	
	1 Corinthians 4:1-2 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
	
3. The works of men, particularly the purity and the motif behind the things you do. He also rewards the degree to conformity to patterns
	Revelation 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
	
	1 Corinthians 3:12-15 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
	Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
	If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
	If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
	
	
** God's Reward Principle **
Mark 1:32-37 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
And all the city was gathered together at the door.
And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.

God designed the reward system of the Kingdom to function based on the discovery, the development and the deployment of your gift.
Proverbs 18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.

The word gift means your value, skill, potential or ability.
Everything that constitutes an advantage to your life and can be deployed to serve the purposes of God and to be a blessing to humanity is what the bible refers to your gift.
Your value decides who pursues you and the extent of your reward. 

** What do you do with the gift of God in your life **
Knowing you are gifted is not enough, you must pay the price to develop it.
The reward is not in the discovery, it is in the development and deployment
1. Discover it
2. Develop it: Be prepared to go through the furnace of afflication.
	Sacrifice is the language of champions. Nobody becomes great at their terms
	Knowledge is not a gift, you buy the truth
	
You must master the mysteries of the presence of God.
You must master the mysteries of the annointing.
You must master the mysteries of dominion.
You must master the mysteries of influence.
You must master the mysteries of the Word of God.

When God wants to schedule a season of reward, he puts something in your hand
Exodus 4:2 And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.
And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

You must cast that rod and worship God with it. Handover that rod to God to refine it
Exodus 4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

The value of the annointing is that it comes upon a prepared vessel.
While you wait for power make sure you tarry in Jerusalem praying.
While you wait for power make sure you are not idle, keep working on your leadership skills
While you wait for the annointing keep working on your human relation skills
While you wait for the annointing keep working to understand the dynamics of ministry
 
While you wait for the annointing keep studying

The reward system of the Kingdom is based on God's ability to annoint your value.
The union between the supernatural annointing of the Holy Spirit coming upon your value, skill, ability, gifting that has been dicovered, developed and refined with pain, patience, sacrifice, that is what schedules seasons of reward.

Our rewards will be in exact ratio to:
	- The demand for what you do
	- Your proficiency in doing what you do
	- The difficulty in replacing you
	
Leadership is about excelling in your gift. Serving people with your gift with such excellence that you get a reward of loyalty back from the people by reason of the effective deployment of your gift.
