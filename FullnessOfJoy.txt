**Fullness Of Joy**

John 16:24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

James 4:1-3 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask
	not.

Ask: To request information / an answer by saying / writing
	 To invite and allow into your space
	 To inquire price / cost of a thing
	 
What do you ask for:
Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things SOEVER YE DESIRE, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, 
	and ye shall have them.

2 Peter 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us ALL THINGS THAT PERTAIN UNTO LIFE AND GODLINESS, 
	through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
	
Who do you ask
James 1:5 If any of you LACK wisdom, let him ASK OF GOD, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; 
	and it shall be given him.
	
How do you ask
Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when YE PRAY, BELIEVE that ye receive them, 
	and ye shall have them.
	
James 1:5-7 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ASK OF GOD, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; 
	and it shall be given him.
	But let him ask IN FAITH, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and 
	tossed.
	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
	
Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that 
	he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
	
Acts 8:5-8 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
		 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, HEARING AND SEEING the miracles which 
		 he did.
		 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with 
		 palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
		 And there was great joy in that city.
		 
**Receiving**
Receive: To take / get something that has been given.
		 To come into possession
		 To assimilate through your mind
		 To permit to enter your space
		
How to receive
1. By faith based on God's integrity and ability
	Ephesians 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power 
		that worketh in us,

How to know God has answered
1. Peace
	Psalm 85:8 I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them 
		not turn again to folly.
	Philippians 4:6-7 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your 
		requests be made known unto God.
		And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
		
	When your peace is taken away, pray until another Word comes from God to give you peace.
	
2. Prophetic instructions that demand action
	John 2:5-9 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
		And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two 
		or three firkins apiece.
		Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
		And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
		When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: 
		(but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
		
	John 9
	
3. When you pray, be sensitive to the ministry of men
	Luke 6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, 
		shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
