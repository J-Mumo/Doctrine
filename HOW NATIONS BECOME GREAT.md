Nations just like organizations, families and individuals can become great.
Genesis 12:1-3 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

Deuteronomy 28:1-2 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

Joshua 3:7 And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

## Principles responsible for the greatness of individuals, nations, cooperations
1. Vision: The ability as they ought to be, and not just as they are, alongside the determination to bring that picture to manifestation.
   Proverbs 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
   Habakkuk 2:2-3 And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
   For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
   ### Understanding vision
   1. Understand history: Helps us connect things past, to make sense out of things past, then to be able to come up with resolutions that out of those resolutions we will come up with profound pictures that lead us to the feature.
   2. Understand destiny: Where we are going to
   3. Understand the unity component of vision: An agreement to all go the same direction

2. Values / policies: Values define people's ideas about life and gives them a template for living and conducting their lives.
   Crime, corruption, laziness, entitlement mentality, are not just evil actions, they are products of a mindset
   Love, respect, diligence, productivity, responsibility, are not just good actions, they are products of a belief system.

3. Education: The ability to read, write, communicate effectively, think constructively and use the knowledge acquired as a tool to birth solutions.
   Daniel 1:4 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
   Daniel 1:17-21 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
   Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
   And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.
   And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.
   And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

   Utterance: A spiritual quality, it comes from God. The abilty to skip so that anybody regardless their intellectual level can understand you. 
   Oratory: The abilty to use words as a tool to transfer thoughts.

   Psalm 95:3 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
   2 Chronicles 15:12-15 And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
   That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
   And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
   And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.
