Matthew 16:13-17 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?
And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

John 16:12-13 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

## 6 dimensions of knowledge the believer must pursue
1. You must know God and Jesus His son
  Proverbs 9:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.

  Daniel 11:32b but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.

  Ephesians 1:15-19 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
  Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
  The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
  And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

2. You must know yourself in light of who Christ is
  Psalm 49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

  1 Peter 2:9 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;

  Ephesians 2:1-6 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
  Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
  But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
  Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
  And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

3. You need to know your place in destiny and God's prophetic programme
  Luke 4:16-17 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

  Hebrews 10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

4. You must understand the mystries and the principals of the kingdom
  Job 38:33-35 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
  Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
  Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?

  Psalm 82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

  Matthew 13:11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.

5. You must understand man as the highest of God's creation and the cosmos (world)
  Psalm 8:1-6 O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
  Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
  When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
  What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
  For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
  Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:

  Psalm 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.

  Matthew 10:16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

6. You must know the adversary the devil
  John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:

  1 Peter 5:8-9 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
  Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

## 4 channels to knowing God
1. Scripture
  John 1:1-3 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
  The same was in the beginning with God.
  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

2. A study of His names
  Exodus 3:13-15 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
  And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.
  And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

  Exodus 6:1-3 Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
  And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:
  And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.

3. Jesus Christ
  Hebrews 1:1-3 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
  Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:

4. Experience
  Job 42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.

  1 John 1:1-5 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;
  (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)
  That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
  And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
  This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

  Acts 17:16-17 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
  Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.

  Acts 17:22-26 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
  For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To The Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
  God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
  Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
  And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;

## About God
1. God is infinite
  Isaiah 40:28 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.

2. There are 3 qualities of God that stand Him above all
  1. Omnipresent
    Psalm 139:7-12 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
    If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
    If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
    Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
    If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
    Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

  2. Omnipotent
    Psalm 62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.

  3. Omniscient

### For our profiting and dominion on earth, there are three things we must focus on
1. His character
  Exodus 33:18-19 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
  And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.

  Isaiah 40:28-30 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.
  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.
  Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:

  Psalms 145:8-20 The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
  The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
  All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.
  They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
  To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
  Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
  The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
  The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
  Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
  The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
  The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
  He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
  The Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.

  Psalms 103:1-5 Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.

  Revelation 22:13 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.

  2 Timothy 1:12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

  1 Thessalonians 5:24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

  Ecclesiastes 3:14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.

  #### Who God destroys
  1. Enemies. It is anybody who perpetually interrupts the manifestation of His will

2. His ways
  Psalm 25:4-5 Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.
  Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

3. The knowledge of His power
  Power is the ability to cause or force change.
  Supernatural solutions by the Spirit of God.

  Psalm 63:1-2 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
  To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.

  Matthew 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

  Ephesians 1:18-21 The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
  And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
  Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
  Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:

  Acts 4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

  1 Samuel 17:44-47 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
  Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
  This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
  And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.

  Psalm 66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
