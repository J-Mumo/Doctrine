** Preserving Territorial Revival **
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evENKZ4BVrc&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Kingdom advance is territorial
From a stand point of revival is to keep God's consiousness, righteousness and to keep the program of Go alive across our assigned territories.

Revival: A re-awakening to true spirituality, righteousness and genuine submission of the governing authority of the Christ
Revival is 3 fold: - Personal, church, territorial transformation

God's end time program will require 3 categories of people.
1. Watchmen / prophetic intercessors
	2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
	
	Isaiah 62:1-7 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.
	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.
	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
	Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
	For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence,
	And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
	
	Ezekiel 22:23-31 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
	Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
	Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
	And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken.
	The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
	And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
	Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord God.
	
2. Saviors / the sent ones
	Obadiah 1:21 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's.
	
3. Kingdom Financiers
	Zechariah 1:17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
	
	** Assignments of money in the kingdom **
	1. Help you live a comfortable life
	2. Provide financial resources for kingdom advance
	3. Empower you to become a blessing in a dying world in a practical and definite way
	
** Keys to preserve revival **
1. Ministry of warfare and intercession
	
2. Regular convergence of believers within that territory for the purpose of training, equiping and empowerment
	Acts 2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
	Jeremiah 3:15 nd I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
	
3. An open display of the power of God (miracles, signs and wonders)
	Acts 19:11-20 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:
	So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
	And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.
	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
	And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.
	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
	
	John 4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
	
4. *Intentional mentorship of younger believers and ministers to ensure continuity
	2 Timothy 2:2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
	
5. Influence: God's people must rise to prominence so as to protect and defent the interests of the kingdom.
	Genesis 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
	
6. An open display of love by the church to society
	Matthew 5:45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
