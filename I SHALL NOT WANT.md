Psalm 23:1 The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.

Financial prosperity in the kingdom is a combination of the following:
1. Laws and principles
2. Human factors
3. Divine empowerment
4. The help of God

The starting point of every financial journey is an awareness of the following:
1. It is the will of God for you to prosper financially
  Proverbs 10:22 The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
  Deuteronomy 8:18 But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.
  Psalms 35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
  1 Timothy 6:17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;

2. Financial prosperity is one of the blessings that come with loving and serving God.
  Job 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

3. You can have abundant financial resources without knowing / loving the Loed, but the peace and fulfilment that comes with it only comes from God.
  Proverbs 10:22 The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
  John 14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

4. Wealth and abundance in the kingdom is a function of laws, human factors, divine empowerment and the help of God.

5. God does not decide who becomes wealthy or who remains poor.
  Deuteronomy 30:15-20 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
  In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
  But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
  I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
  I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
  That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

  Proverbs 22:2 The rich and poor meet together: the Lord is the maker of them all.

6. Kingdom wealth is not about being a millionaire/billionaire. It is about having supplies that meet your needs, that empower you to support the work of the kingdom, that empower you to bless your world.

Ecclesiastes 10:15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

  Genesis 13:1-5 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
  And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
  And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
  Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.
  And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

  The easiest way to prosper is by relationships.
  Life will be as difficult as relationships that are missing in your life.

  ### How to maximize relationships
  1. Praying that God brings the right people into your life.
  2. Becoming a person of character so that when God brings those people to your life, those people will not see you as curse to their life.

5. Ecclesiastes 11:2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
   Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight; you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
   But divide your investments among many places,[a] for you do not know what risks might lie ahead.
   Put your investments in several places—many places even—because you never know what kind of bad luck you are going to have in this world.

   The only way money grows and the only way money multiplies is through investments.

### 5 kinds of investments
1. Spiritual
2. Mental
3. Health and wellbeing
4. Strategic relationships
