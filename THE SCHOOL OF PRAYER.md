Prayer that produces power can be taught.
Luke 11:1 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

Luke 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.

Colossians 4:2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

James 5:16 Confess to one another therefore your faults (your slips, your false steps, your offenses, your sins) and pray [also] for one another, that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].

Prayer: Communication with God.
        Platform to communicate our thoughts, needs and desires.
        Platform for fellowship with God.
        Platform to hear and receive from God.

## Why Pray
1. Those who ask in prayer receive.
  Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man IN OUR IMAGE, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

  God gave man a will. It became illegal for God to superimpose Himself on man without the man agreeing. 

  Matthew 7:7-8 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

  Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

2. Prayer is not the answer to everything but must be involved in everything.
  Philippians 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

## Assignments of prayer
1. Growth and transformation of the believer.
  Luke 9:29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.

2. Platform to make requests and obtain promises.
  Mark 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

  Philippians 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

3. Platform to make decrees and establish spiritual realities.
  Job 22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

  Numbers 14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

4. Warfare and intercession.
  Warfare: The spiritual system by which we use the Word of God in prayer to establish the victory that has been wrought in Christ.
  1 Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

  John 10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: ...

  Luke 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

## Kinds of prayer.
Ephesians 6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

1. Praying in the Spirit / praying in tongues.
  1 Corinthians 14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.

  1 Corinthians 14:2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

  1 Corinthians 14:4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.

2. Faith filled declaration of scriptures. The secret to this kind of prayer is vastness the Word of God.
  Psalm 107:2-3 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
  And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.

  Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

3. The prayer of enquiry. The secret to this kind of prayer is patience.
  1 Samuel 30:8 And David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.

4. Warfare prayer.
  Philippians 1:19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

5. The prayer of thanksgiving
  Colossians 4:2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

  Philippians 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

## How God answers prayers
1. Supernatural manifestations: Peace, joy, healing, deliverance
  Daniel 3:24-25 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
  He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.

2. Releasing the graces that attract the physical result: Wisdom, favor, dircetion, understanding
  1 Kings 3:5-13 In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
  And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
  And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
  And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
  Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
  And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
  And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
  Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
  And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.

3. The ministry of men
  1 Samuel 10:26-27 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
  But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.

  Numbers 1:5 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.

  Luke 10:29-36 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
  And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
  And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
  And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
  But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,
  And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
  And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.
  Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
