John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

## Reasons you should believe in the concept of greater works
1. Jesus Christ said so
  Numbers 23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

2. The believer has been given authority through Christ
  Matthew 28:18-20 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

  Luke 10:19 Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

  Ephesians 2:6And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

3. Access to the Spirit of God
  Acts 1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

  Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

## Reasons Jesus used the word greater
1. While Jesus walked upon the earth, he largely did what he did alone. But today all believers can carry out this mandate and have access to the Spirit bringing greater efficiency.
  John 12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

2. Inspite of the many miracles Jesus performed while on earth, there was one miracle, which was the greatest need of man he could not perform.
   He could not give eternal life before he died.
   Colossians 1:12-14 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
   Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
   In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

   Colossians 1:19-20 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
   And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

   Ephesians 1:7 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;

## Ultimate goal of greater works
The knowldege of the glory of God fills the entire earth drawing many to Jesus.
  Habakkuk 2:14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

  Isaiah 40:5 And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

  John 4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

  John 20:30-31 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.

  Daniel 3:28-29 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
  Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

## Spiritual forces that must be engaged for every believer to walk in the experience of greater works
1. The force of prayer. How to use prayer as a tool to birth and establish the purposes og God across a territory
  2 Chronicles 7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

2. The force of wisdom
  Mark 6:2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?

  James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

  Isaiah 11:2 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

  Wisdom: The accurate application of spiritual knowledge
          The supernatural ability to use the written and inspired Word of God to make accurate decisions and provide solutions to life's problems

  ### 4 kinds of wisdom
  James 3:13-17 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

  1. Earthly wisdom, common sense, instincts. The natural ability to respond to right and wrong
  2. Sensual wisdom / scientific wisdom: Wisdom that comes through study, science, philosophy
  3. Devilish / demonic wisdom: A sense of recognizing right and wrong by demonic motivations
  4. Wisdom from above: Godly supernatural wisdom
    1 Corinthians 2:7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

     Luke 1:17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

     Daniel 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.

   ### Keys to access wisdom
   1. Listen to wise men
   2. The book of wisdom

  ### Benefits of wisdom
  1. Wisdom strenghtens and secures
     Ecclesiastes 7:19 Wisdom strengthens the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
  2. Wisdom protects and preserves
     Ecclesiastes 7:12 For wisdom is a protection even as money is a protection,
     But the [excellent] advantage of knowledge is that wisdom shields and preserves the lives of its possessors.
   3. Wisdom brings efficiency
      Ecclesiastes 10:10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

3. Force of faith
   Hebrews 11:1-2 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
   For by it the elders obtained a good report.
   Hebrews 11:33-36 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.
   Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
   Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
   And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

   ### Reasons we need faith
   1. There are realities beonnd the scope of sigh and beyond the scope of science
     Colossians 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

   2. Faith commits God in the affairs of men
      John 11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
      Luke 1:37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

4. The force of wealth and abundance
   Zechariah 1:17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

   Deuteronomy 8:18 But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

   Matthew 28:1-15 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
   And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
   His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
   And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.
   And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
   He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
   And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
   And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
   And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
   Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
   Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
   And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
   Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
   And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
   So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

5. The force of influence. Influence is power
   Influence: The capacity to have an effect in the character, perceptions, behaviours, decisions and the values of another.
   Matthew 5:13-15 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
   Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
   Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

   The key to influence is results

6. The force of the prophetic
   Exodus 17:8-15 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
   And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.
   So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
   And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
   But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
   And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
   And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
   And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:

   ### All believers can enjoy the blessings of the prophetic through:
   1. The Word of God
      2 Peter 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:

   2. The ministry of the Holy Spirit
      John 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

      1 Corinthians 2:10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

   3. The prophetic - Where one by call or alignment is able to communicate the counsel of God
      Ephesians 4:11-13 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
      For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
      Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
