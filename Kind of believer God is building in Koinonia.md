Isaiah 46:10 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

1. Spiritually vibrant. Men and women who are passionate lovers of Jesus and of the things of God.
2. A believer with character. A growing determination to be like Jesus in experience.
3. Intelligent and transformed believers alongside the ability to apply the Word towards a victorious life
  Isaiah 11:3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
4. Responsible, purpose driven and effective believers
5. Agents of societal and territorial transformation
  Matthew 5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
