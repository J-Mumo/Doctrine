https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo5LzvyjxF0&ab_channel=KoinoniaGlobal

Bible: A collection of 66 books.
       At least 40 writers.
       Written over a period of over 1500 years.

2 Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

God prevailed upon the authors of the bible so that while using their own styles of writing and levels of understanding, God prevailed over them and they recorded as God intended.

All scripture was guided and inspired by God, He did not dictate the bible.
The central point of the bible is God, His love for creation, man's fall and his inadequecies, Jesus as the Savior and only remedy, and the gospel and salvation in its entire scope.
The accuracy of the bible is not in the flawlessness of its writings but in its ability to deliver God's intent as far as the revelation of God, Jesus, man and salvation.
The bible is not flawless as an archeological material, historic material or capture of literature.
When Jesus and the plan of salvation becomes your compass for navigating scripture, then it is accurate.

### If the bible is focused on God, can a believer us the bible to study other issues in life
2 Timothy 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

While Jesus walked upon the earth, His focus was salvation, but he addressed various issues on human life.

Ephesians 1:17-19 That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

Every statement in the bible contains within it lessons/ principles that can help the believer to walk in victory.
Romans 15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

Every story, statement, expression in the bible under the influence of the spirit of revelation can bring the believer to profit.

## The assignments of the spirit of revelation
1. To give you light from scripture. To connect the believer to God's eternal plan.
  2 Timothy 3:14-15 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
  And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

2. Help you draw out lessons / principles from scripture that empower you to walk in total victory.

3. Inspring the mind of the believer to birth thoughts and ideas that translate to productivity and advancement.
  Isaiah 11:1-2 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
  And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

  Job 32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

4. Activates the various prophetic dimentions in the believer.
  Joel 2:28-29 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
  And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
