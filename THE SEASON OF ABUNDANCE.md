Psalm 66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.

Abundance is about supplies and sufficiency, and not just finance alone.

## Somethings to know about God.
1. The earth has He given to the sons of men.
  Psalm 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
  Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

2. God is a God of portions
  Ecclesiastes 5:9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.

  Joshua 13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the Lord said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

## Factors responsible for lack, want and poverty
1. Ignorance or incomplete knowledge of God's financial system.
2. The absence of value that is needed and useful.
3. Lack of productivity and excellence.
  Productivity: Converting you value to products and services, serving them with excellence to a targeted consumer base.
4. Absence of strategic relationships.
5. The bankruptcy of spiritual empowerment.
6. Impatience.
  Proverbs 28:20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
7. Laziness: The laxity to think, the laxity to take action.

The world system is founded on hatred, disdain for God and His ways.
e.g; selfishness, self-centeredness

In this kingdom, there is a difference between wealth, abundance and kingdom wealth.

### Reasons why God blesses the saints
1. To live a comfortable life.
2. To advance the course of the kingdom.
3. To be a blessing to the world in a practical and definite way.
  Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

1 Chronicles 29:11-12 Thine, O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.
Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

## Dynamics of manifesting the resources of God.
The secret to stepping into accelerated wealth, is strategic destiny connections.
Relationships are currencies that can buy anything money can buy.
You are as wealthy as men whose hands are open unto you.

1. Your relationship with God gives you access to wisdom and favor.
2. Wisdom and favor gives you access to men and systems.
3. Men will give you access to resources and influence.
4. You use the influence and the resources to serve God, to be a blessing to men and live a succesful life.

## What this means:
1. Like never before you should get closer to God, because He is the fountain of wisdom and the true source of favor.
2. When wisdom and favour rests on you, men will come.
  Isaiah 60:3 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
