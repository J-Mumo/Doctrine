Acts 11:19-26 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

Matthew 28: 18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 Go [a]therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” [b]Amen.

Discipleship: 
  The ongoing process of progressively becoming lke Jesus Christ in thought, words and actions through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit.
  Lifelong journey of spiritual growth, transformation and conformity to the character of Christ in experience.
  The intentional and structured mentoring of believers so that they progressively attain unto spiritual maturity and stature in experience.
  Building the culture of the kingdom in believers

  Titus 3:1-8 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
  To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
  For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
  But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
  Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
  That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
  This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

  Ephesians 5:1-2 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
  And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

  Strategically transforming those who will eventuallt transform their territories and nations.
  Discipleship is simply about building men, human capital development.

The church is the most reliable institution on earth with the divinely accredited strategy for reforming and transforming men.
Educating the human mind alone may produce an intelligent person, but cannot produce a reformed and transformed person.
Most of the problems in homes, workspaces, marriages, communities, nations and the world today are as a result of lack of discipleship.
A transformed people will translate to a healthy kingdom, a great society.

Most of the problems in homes, workspaces, pulipits can be corrected through discipleship.
Discipleship can benefit anyone, saved or unsaved. But bible discipleship is only most profitable to believers, those who have received salvation through Jesus Christ.
An unbeliever needs salvation first before he can benefit maximally from discipleship.
Transformation is by the Spirit and through the Word.

## Aspects of Discipleship
  1. Knowledge-based discipleship: This is becoming like Christ by contending for a sound superior knowledge of scripture.
     The Word of God alongside word compliant materials.

  2. Lifestyle-based discipleship: Deciding to adopt the culture and the lifestyle of the kingdom as demonstrated by Jesus and replicating that lifestyle as enabled by the Spirit.
     Growing into a lifestyle of obedience and surrender that reflects the life of Jesus.
     Living out the fruit of the Spirit in experience.
     A complete change of lifestyle and behaviour to reflect the value of Christ.
     
Discipleship must capture certain teachings or elements or else it can become a religious ritual that can keep people in bondage.
Discipleship is not about making slaves out of people in an attempt to appease the standards set by men.

## Elements of discipleship
  1. Salvation through the finished work of Jesus Christ.
     Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
     Not of works, lest any man should boast.

  2. The responsibility of obedience and alignment in becoming like Christ.

  3. Walk in love; love for God and love for people.
     Ephesians 5:1-2 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
     And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

  4. The value of living by the Word.
     Matthew 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

  5. How to live by faith.
     Ephesians 6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

     Hebrews 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.

  6. Productivity as a key to impact and economic emancipation.

  7. Responsibility as a lifestyle.

  8. Selflessness: Everything lives when it serves a purpose bigger than itself.

## Tools for effective discipleship
  1. The ministry of the Holy Spirit.
     John 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

  2. The Word of God.
     2 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

  3. The presence of teachers, mentors or role models.
     Jeremiah 3:15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

  4. A spiritual family: A community of like minded believers that allow for fellowship and social interactions.
     Kingdom community living is one of the major ways to sustain kingdom values.
     Hebrews 10:24-25 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
     Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

  5. A platform for service.
    Matthew 20:27-28 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
    Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

## Fruits of discipleship
  1. The fruit of the Spirit.
     Galatians 5:22-23 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
     Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

  2. Death to self. A detachment from an excessive love for pleasure. To embrace a life of modesty even in the presence of abundance.

  3. Placing priority on Jesus as the most important relationship in your life.

  4. Freedom from mammon. The ungodly attachment to money and other material things.

  5. Victory and dominion by engaging the mysteries of the kingdom.

  6. Freedom from fear of persecution and death.
