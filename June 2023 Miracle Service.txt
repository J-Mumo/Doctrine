1. You must be grateful. Practice gratitude as a lifestyle.
  Always be thankful to God at all times for all things

2. Make up your mind to be a blessing by living for a cause beyond yourself
  Genesis 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

  Philipians 2:1-4 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
  Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
  Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things

  Matthew 20:25-28 ut Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
  But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
  And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
  Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

3. You must become a passionate lover of God and men.
  Matthew 22:36-40 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
  This is the first and great commandment.
  And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

  ** Benefits of loving God **
  1. Mercy
    Exodus 20:5-6 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
    And shewing MERCY unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

  2. Ever increasing greatness
    Judges 5:31 So let all Your enemies perish, O Lord; But let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.

    Psalm 71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.

  3. All things work together for you
    Romans 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.
