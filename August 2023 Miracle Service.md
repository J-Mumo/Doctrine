Luke 1:68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,

The supernatural and the miraculous is at the very foundation of the christian faith.
Acts 14:3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

Acts 8:6-7 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.

The supernatural is only brought about by the power of God.
Matthew 10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

Luke 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

1. To activate the power of God, you need to know the will of God as revealed in His word.
  1 John 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

  Ephesians 5:16-17 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
  Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.

  For example, your health and vitality. God desires us to walk in wholeness and perfection of health
  Matthew 10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

  Acts 10:38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

  Matthew 10:7-8 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

2. You must a place a demand by faith
  Hebrews 4:1-2 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
