Luke 9:28-32 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.
And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:
Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

2 Corinthians 3:17-18 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

Ephesians 3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:

Revelation 4:1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

It takes focus, hunger, meekness to look, after this.

Philippians 3:13-14 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.

Come up hither is a journey to higher levels of authority and power, it happens by higher levels of illumination and revelation.

Revelation 5:1 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.

Revelation 5:6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

Revelation 6:1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.

Revelation 6:3 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.

Revelation 6:5 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

The business is about seeing.
Your knowledge is at the mercy of what you see.
Jeremiah 33:3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.

1 Corinthians 8:2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.

### Hinderances that can stop you from coming up hither
1. Disinterest towards God and spiritual things (prayer, the Word, fellowship).
  2 Timothy 3:1-4 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

2. The state of the heart, the corruption of your heart.
  Jeremiah 17:9-10 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?
  I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.

  Psalm 24:3-4 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?
  He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

  What makes your heart pure: The desire in your heart to see God glorified beyond making a name for yourself.

3. Lack of proper mentorship and guidance.
  Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

  You will reflect the accuracy or the limitations of those you choose to follow.
    Acts 8:30-31 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
    And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
