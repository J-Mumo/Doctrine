** Discerning The Will Of God **

Ephesians 5:15-17 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
	
Daniel 11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.

You command power in this kingdom to the degree to which you understand and walk in the will of God

Colossians 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

Hebrews 10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.

Hebrews 13:20-21 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

John 4:34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

Matthew 6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Luke 22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

Matthew 12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

John 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

** 4 keys to discern and walk in the will of God **
1. Life of total surrender
	John 5:40 Luke 22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
	
2. The Word of God: The wisdom that comes from the Word of God
	Psalm 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path: Guidance and direction
	
	Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
	
	Luke 4:18-19 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
	To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
	
3. Strategic prayers; particularly praying in the spirit (praying in tongues)
	1 Corinthians 2:6-16 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ.
	
	Isaiah 30:21  And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
	
	Jeremiah 33:3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
	
4. Patience
	Hebrews 10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
	
	Hebrews 6:15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
	
** When God is silent **
1. He is working on you
2. He is working on other factors needed to help you do His will
	Luke 1:39-44 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;
	And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.
	And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
	And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
	For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
	
	Elizabeth had to wait 
	
3. It is possible that He is fighting unseen battles and averting certain dangers that the devil is already programming for you.
