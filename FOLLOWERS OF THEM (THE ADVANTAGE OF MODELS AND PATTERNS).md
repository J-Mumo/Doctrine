Hebrews 6:12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

## Dimensions to transformation
1. Principal of followership (looking unto men)
2. Law of beholding (looking unto Jesus)
  Hebrews 12:1-2 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

God's methods are far superior to man's methods.
  Isaiah 55:8-9 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.
  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

  Jeremiah 6:16 Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.

Patterns forerun the glory of God.
  Exodus 25:9 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.
  Exodus 25:40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.
  Exodus 40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.
  Exodus 40:33-34 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
  Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

  Leviticus 9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.

  ### Some existing patterns
  - Kingdom influence
  - Power in the spirit
  - Leadership and excellence in life
  - Activate the prophetic within your spirit
  - Turns you into a warrior in the spirit
  - Marvellously favoured even prosperous of the Lord
  - Longevity
  - Church growth and increase
  - Excellence within the secular system

Followership is one of the mystries of the kingdom by which men become mighty.
  Matthew 4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
  Acts 4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

Human models inspire hunger and passion in the hearts of those who follow them.
A model is an example, a template, a reference, a prototype, foundations.

Transformation and replication is very easy when there are models and references.
Transformation and replication is as hard as the distance between you and the models.
  Isaiah 9:8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.


### Limitations of pioneering
1. It requires humility to keep growing and not to fight improvements when you see it.

## The advantage of having models and patterns
1. All models must remain students and never have an arrival mentality.

## Profitable followership
1. Demands genuine connection and loyalty
2. Only becomes profitable when the follower remains a student.
  Luke 6:40 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
3. Must factor the limitations in the vessels that they follow.
  Never expect God-like perfection from the people you follow.
