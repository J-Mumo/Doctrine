** The Voice Of God **

Psalm 29:3-9 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the Lord is upon many waters.
The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty.
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.
The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.

Ezekiel 43:1-2 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.

Psalm 23

Romans 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

The Voice of God is not limited to the speakings of God alone, but it represents all the SPIRITUAL CHANNELS and pathways that God uses to communicate His WILL and INTENT.

Hebrews 1:1-2 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;

** Channels for God's communication **
1. The Holy Scripture
	2 Timothy 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
	
2. Dreams, visions and supernatural encounters
	
3. The prophetic
	Hosea 12:10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
	
4. The knowing / the witness of the Spirit
	Romans 8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
	
The language of God is light
1 John 1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

Psalms 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.

Matthew 17:5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

The goal of the speakings of God is not just to supply information but also to give His intent and His will.

The assignment of your mind is to give the light of God vocubulary expressions so that understanding can be established.

Ephesians 5:17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
