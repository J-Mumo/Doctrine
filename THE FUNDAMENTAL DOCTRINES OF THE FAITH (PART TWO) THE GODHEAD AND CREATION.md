  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

  And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
  That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
